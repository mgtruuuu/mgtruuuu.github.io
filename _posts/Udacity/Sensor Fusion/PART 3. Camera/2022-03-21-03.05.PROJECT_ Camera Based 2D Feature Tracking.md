## 1. Mid-Term Project Introduction

### Course Overview

Over the next few weeks, you will gain knowledge and learn new skills in the areas of camera technology, computer vision, and sensor fusion between Camera and Lidar.

In the final project, you will develop an algorithm to estimate the time-to-collision until a vehicle collides with an obstacle in front of it. To make this project as realistic as possible, you will use data from a vehicle equipped with a forward-facing camera and a high-resolution Lidar sensor.

The course is divided into the following sections:

- Lesson 2: Autonomous Vehicles and Computer Vision
    - Levels of autonomous driving
    - Autonomous vehicle sensor sets
    - Camera technology
    - Computer vision and the OpenCV

- Lesson 3: Engineering a Collision Detection System
    - Collision detection basics
    - Estimating time-to-collision with Lidar
    - Estimating time-to-collision with a camera

- Lesson 4: Tracking Image Features
    - Intensity gradient and filtering
    - Harris corner detection
    - Overview of popular keypoint detectors
    - Gradient-based vs. binary descriptors
    - Descriptor matching
    - Tracking an object across images

- Project: Camera-Based 2D Feature Tracking

- Lesson 6: Combining Camera and Radar
    - Lidar-to-camera point projection
    - Object detection with YOLO
    - Standard computer vision vs deep learning
    - Creating 3D-objects

- Project: Track an Object in 3D Space


### Course Github Repo

Besides, the workspaces provided in the classroom, the exercise-code, and the corresponding solution can also be found in the following [Github repo](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Camera).



## 2. The Data Buffer

Throughout the Camera course, you will perspectives about Camera from Timo Rehfeld. Timo develops sensor fusion algorithms at MBRDNA. In the next video, Timo will tell you a little bit about himself and his role at MBRDNA.
