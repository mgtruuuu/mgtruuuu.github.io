## 1. Range, Velocity, and Angle Resolution

{% include video id="zV8MENLn0M0" provider="youtube" %}

In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of range and velocity estimation using doppler and Fourier transform techniques. Before you get started, let's have a look at three primary dimensions of measurement for radar resolution.

![Capability of a radar to resolve two targets based on differences in their distance, angle and velocity](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb8aeb_image8/image8.png)
>Capability of a radar to resolve two targets based on differences in their distance, angle and velocity

The capability of a radar to resolve targets is very critical for an accurate perception.

- **Range Resolution:**

    It is the capability of the radar to **distinguish between two targets that are very close to each other in range**. If a radar has range resolution of 4 meters then it cannot separate on range basis a pedestrian standing 1 meter away from the car.

    The range resolution is solely dependent on the bandwidth of the chirp $B_\textrm{sweep}$:

    $d_\textrm{res} = \frac{c} {2 B_\textrm{sweep}}$

- **Velocity Resolution:**

    If two targets have the same range they can still be resolved if they are traveling **at different velocities**. The velocity resolution is dependent on the number of chirps. As discussed for our case we selected to send 128 chirps. **A higher number of chirps increases the velocity resolution, but it also takes longer to process the signal.**

- **Angle Resolution:**

    Radar is capable of separating two targets spatially. If two targets are at similar range travelling at same velocities, then they can still be resolved **based on their angle** in radar coordinate system. **Angle resolution depends on different parameters depending on the angle estimation technique used.** We will cover this in more detail in the next lesson.





## 2. Range Estimation

>**Note**  
In the video above, the formula for calculating `Range` should be: `Range = c * Fb * Ts / (2 * Bsweep)`


### Range Estimation Overview

![Signal trip time for a radar signal](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb8bdc_image5/image5.png)
>Signal trip time for a radar signal

Radar determines the range of the target by measuring the trip time of the electromagnetic signal it radiates. **It is known that EM wave travels at a known speed (300,000,000 m/s), so to determine the range the radar needs to calculate the trip time. How?**

**Answer : By measuring the shift in the frequency.**


### Range Estimation Equation

![Range Estimation using FMCW](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb8c73_image3/image3.png)
>Range Estimation using FMCW - source: Delft University of Technology

The FMCW waveform has the characteristic that the frequency varies linearly with time. **If radar can determine the delta between the received frequency and hardware’s continuously ramping frequency then it can calculate the trip time and hence the range.** *We further divide Range estimate by 2, since the frequency delta corresponds to two way trip.*

It is important to understand that **if a target is stationary then a transmitted frequency and received frequency are the same**. But, the ramping frequency within the hardware is continuously changing with time. So, when we take the delta (**beat frequency**) between the received and ramping frequency we get the trip time.

$R = \frac{c \cdot T_s \cdot f_b} {2 \cdot B_\textrm{sweep}}$


. **Here, $f_b$ is the beat frequency, which is measured by the radar by subtracting the received frequency from the hardware’s ramping frequency:**

$f_b = f_\textrm{ramping} - f_\textrm{received}$
​

. As seen in the equation, the range calculation requires chirp time $T_s$ and chirp Bandwidth $B_\textrm{sweep}$. **Those values are determined as we define the configuration of the radar *based on its range resolution and trip time for Radar’s maximum range*.**


### System Level Range Calculation

![Range Calculation - System Level](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb8f65_image2/image2.png)
>Range Calculation - System Level - source [here](https://www.electronicdesign.com/)

As seen in the image above, the Synthesizer generates FMCW chirp for a given $B_\textrm{sweep}$ and $T_s$. Let’s say the signal gets transmitted at 77GHz and it returns to the radar after hitting the target in a certain time duration. The radar receiver captures the signal, processes (subtraction) and measures the frequency delta between received signal and linearly ramping signal. This delta in frequency is called as **beat frequency** and it is *proportional to the trip time*. So based on the equation above, the radar calculates the range.


### Range Estimation Exercise

Using the following MATLAB code sample, complete the TODOs to calculate the range in meters of four targets with respective measured beat frequencies [0 MHz, 1.1 MHz, 13 MHz, 24 MHz].

You can use the following parameter values:

- The radar maximum range = 300m
- The range resolution = 1m
- The speed of light c = 3*10^8

>**Note**  
The sweep time can be computed based on the time needed for the signal to travel the maximum range. In general, for an FMCW radar system, the sweep time should be at least 5 to 6 times the round trip time. This example uses a factor of 5.5:

$T_\textrm{chirp} = 5.5 \cdot 2 \cdot R_\textrm{max} / c$

Print your answer using the `disp` function.

```
% TODO : Find the Bsweep of chirp for 1 m resolution

% TODO : Calculate the chirp time based on the Radar's Max Range

% TODO : define the frequency shifts 

% Display the calculated range
disp(calculated_range);
```


### Solution

>**Note**  
In the solution video, the formula for calculating Bsweep should be: `Bsweep = c / (2 * delta_r);`





## 3. Doppler Estimation

{% include video id="IZmA1dptdT4" provider="youtube" %}


### Doppler Estimation Overview

![Doppler Speed Measurement](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb93d0_image19/image19.png)
>Doppler Speed Measurement

The velocity estimation for radar is based on an age old phenomenon called the **doppler effect**. **As per doppler theory an *approaching target* will shift an emitted and reflected frequency higher, whereas a *receding target* will shift the both frequencies to be lower than the transmitted frequency.**

The same principle is used in the radar guns to catch the speed violators, or even in sports to measure the speed of a ball.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ccb9465_image18/image18.png)

{% include video id="0Dn1WQOitO4" provider="youtube" %}


### FMCW Doppler Measurements

![FMCW Doppler Estimation](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5ce479fc_image8/image8.png)
>FMCW Doppler Estimation - source: Delft University of Technology

As discussed above, there will be a shift in the received signal frequency due to the doppler effect of the target’s velocity. **The doppler shift is directly proportional to the velocity of the target as shown below.**

$f_D = \frac {2 \cdot v_r} {\lambda}$, where

- $f_D$ : shift in the transmitted frequency due to the doppler
- $v_r$ : relative velocity of the target
- $\lambda$ : wavelength of the signal

>>> The presence of the factor 2 can be explained such as:  
The Doppler shift affects the wave incident upon the target as well as the wave reflected back to the radar. So the change in frequency observed by a radar due to a target moving at relative velocity is twice that from the same target emitting a wave.

**By measuring the shift in the frequency due to doppler, radar can determine the velocity.** The *receding target* will have a negative velocity due to the frequency dropping lower, whereas the *approaching target* will have positive velocity as the frequency shifts higher.

**The beat frequency comprises of both frequency components:** $f_r$ (frequency delta due to range) and $f_d$ (frequency shift due to velocity). *Although, in the case of automotive radar the $f_d$ is very small in comparison to the $f_r$.* **Hence, the doppler velocity is calculated by measuring the rate of change of phase across multiple chirps.**

The following equation shows the relationship between the rate of change of the phase $\Phi$, and the frequency:

$\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \textrm{frequency}$


### DOPPLER PHASE SHIFT

Keeping that in consideration, we calculate the doppler frequency by measuring the rate of change of phase. The phase change occurs due to small displacement of a moving target for every chirp duration. Since, each chirp duration is generally in microseconds, it results in small displacement in mm (millimeters). These small displacements for every chirp leads to change in phase. Using this rate of change of phase we can determine the doppler frequency.

Let's see how :

If the path between a target and the radar is changed by an amount $\Delta x$, the phase of the wave received by radar is shifted by

$\Delta \varphi = \frac {\Delta x} {\lambda} \qquad (\lambda = 2\pi \qquad or \qquad 360°)$

$\Delta \varphi = f \cdot \frac {\Delta x} {c} \qquad (\lambda = \frac {c} {f})$, 

where $\lambda$ and $f$ are, respectively, the wavelength and frequency of the signal and $c$ is the speed of propagation. The resulting change in observed frequency is

$\Delta f = \frac {\Delta \varphi} {\Delta t}$

, where ${\Delta t}$ is the time taken for the observation of the phase change.

### Doppler Estimation Exercises

Using the following MATLAB code sample, complete the TODOs to calculate the velocity in m/s of four targets with the following doppler frequency shifts: [3 KHz, -4.5 KHz, 11 KHz, -3 KHz].

You can use the following parameter values:

- The radar's operating frequency = 77 GHz
- The speed of light c = 3*10^8

```

## 4. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

{% include video id="hmU0w8yAM40" provider="youtube" %}


### FFT Overview

{% include video id="aPd52NPB9gc" provider="youtube" %}

So far we discussed the theory of range and doppler estimation along with the equations to calculate them. But, for a radar to efficiently process these measurements digitally, the signal needs to be converted from analog to digital domain and further from time domain to frequency domain.

ADC (Analog Digital Converter) converts the analog signal into digital. But, post ADC the Fast Fourier Transform is used to convert the signal from time domain to frequency domain. Conversion to frequency domain is important to do the spectral analysis of the signal and determine the shifts in frequency due to range and doppler.

![Time Domain to Frequency Domain Conversion using FFT](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cccc069_image22/image22.png)
>Time Domain to Frequency Domain Conversion using FFT - source: mriquestions.com

The traveling signal is in time domain. Time domain signal comprises of multiple frequency components as shown in the image above. In order to separate out all frequency components the FFT technique is used.

For the purpose of this course we don’t have to get into mathematical details of FFT. But, it is important to understand the use of FFT in radar’s digital signal processing. It gives the frequency response of the return signal with each peak in frequency spectrum representing the detected target’s chararcterstics.

### FFT and FMCW

![Fast Fourier Transform](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cccc13f_image16/image16.png)
>Fast Fourier Transform - source: Texas Instruments

As seen in the image below, the Range FFTs are run for every sample on each chirp. Since each chirp is sampled N times, it will generate a range FFT block of N * (Number of chirps). These FFT blocks are also called FFT bins.

![Range FFT](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cccc2b8_image1/image1.png)
>Range FFT - source: Delft University of Technology

Each bin in every column of the block represents an increasing range value so that the end of the last bin represents the maximum range of a radar.

![Output of Range FFT in MATLAB](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cccc643_image11/image11.png)
>Output of Range FFT in MATLAB. X-axis = Beat Frequency, Y-axis = Signal power in dBm

Above is the output of the 1st stage FFT (i.e Range FFT). The three peaks in the frequency domain corresponds to the beat frequencies of three different cars located at 150, 240 and 300 m range from the ego vehicle.

**Why haven't we used real-world raw Radar data in the exercises?**

Currently, no "open-source" "raw" Radar-data is available for "commercial use". Most of the data available online are either "pre-processed" (e.g., [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/)) or constrained with a non-commercial license (e.g., [radar-robotcar-dataset-sdk](https://github.com/oxford-robotics-institute/radar-robotcar-dataset-sdk)). **The techniques taught in this course are only applicable to "raw" data.** However, you can gain hands-on experience with the radar-robotcar-dataset-sdk for non-commercial purposes.


### ast Fourier Transform Exercise

In the following exercise, you will use a Fourier transform to find the frequency components of a signal buried in noise. Specify the parameters of a signal with a sampling frequency of 1 kHz and a signal duration of 1.5 seconds.

To implement the 1st stage FFT, you can use the following steps:

1. Define a signal. In this case (amplitude = `A`, frequency = `f`)

    ```
    signal = A*sin(2*pi*f*t)
    ```

2. Run the FFT for the signal using the MATLAB FFT function for the dimension of samples N.

    ```
    signal_fft = fft(signal,N);
    ```

This returns the N-point DFT. If `N` is not specified, `signal_fft` is the same size as `signal`.

3. The output of FFT processing of a signal is a complex number `a+jb`. Since we just care about the magnitude we take the absolute value `sqrt(a^2+b^2)` of the complex number.

    ```
    signal_fft = abs(signal_fft);
    ```

4. FFT output generates a mirror image of the signal. But we are only interested in the positive half of signal length `L` since it is the replica of the negative half and has all the information we need.

    ```
    signal_fft = signal_fft(1:L/2+1)  
    ```

5. Plot this output against frequency.

You can use the following MATLAB starter code:

```
Fs = 1000;            % Sampling frequency                    
T = 1/Fs;             % Sampling period       
L = 1500;             % Length of signal
t = (0:L-1)*T;        % Time vector

% TODO: Form a signal containing a 77 Hz sinusoid of amplitude 0.7 and a 43Hz sinusoid of amplitude 2.
S = ?

% Corrupt the signal with noise 
X = S + 2*randn(size(t));

% Plot the noisy signal in the time domain. It is difficult to identify the frequency components by looking at the signal X(t).

% TODO : Compute the two-sided spectrum P2. Then compute the single-sided spectrum P1 based on P2 and the even-valued signal length L.

Now that you have implemented FFT in MATLAB, you can optionally try implementing FFT in Python on the next page.





## 5. The 2D FFT

{% include video id="HHk1td_ZTXY" provider="youtube" %}

Once the range bins are determined by running range FFT across all the chirps, a second FFT is implemented along the second dimension to determine the doppler frequency shift. As discussed, the doppler is estimated by processing the rate of change of phase across multiple chirps. Hence, the doppler FFT is implemented after all the chirps in the segment are sent and range FFTs are run on them.

The output of the first FFT gives the beat frequency, amplitude, and phase for each target. This phase varies as we move from one chirp to another (one bin to another on each row) due to the target’s small displacements. Once the second FFT is implemented it determines the rate of change of phase, which is nothing but the doppler frequency shift.

![After running 2nd FFT across the rows of FFT block we get the doppler FFT. The complete implementation is called 2D FFT](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/May/5cdc5db2_image23/image23.png)
>After running 2nd FFT across the rows of FFT block we get the doppler FFT  
The complete implementation is called 2D FFT.  
After 2D FFT each bin in every column of block represents increasing range value and each bin in the row corresponds to a velocity value.

The output of Range Doppler response represents an image with Range on one axis and Doppler on the other. This image is called as Range Doppler Map (RDM). These maps are often used as user interface to understand the perception of the targets.

### 2D FFT In MATLAB

The following steps can be used to compute a 2D FFT in MATLAB:

1. Take a 2D signal matrix

2. In the case of Radar signal processing. Convert the signal in MxN matrix, where M is the size of Range FFT samples and N is the size of Doppler FFT samples:

    ```
    signal  = reshape(signal, [M, N]);
    ```

3. Run the 2D FFT across both the dimensions.

    ```
    signal_fft = fft2(signal, M, N);
    ```

    >**Note**  
    the following from the [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fft2.html):  
    `Y = fft2(X)` returns the 2D FFT of a matrix using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, which is equivalent to computing `fft(fft(X).').'`. If `X` is a multidimensional array, then `fft2` takes the 2-D transform of each dimension higher than 2. The output `Y` is the same size as `X`. `Y = fft2(X,M,N)` truncates `X` or pads `X` with trailing zeros to form an m-by-n matrix before computing the transform. `Y` is m-by-n. If `X` is a multidimensional array, then `fft2` shapes the first two dimensions of `X` according to m and n.
    ```

4. Shift zero-frequency terms to the center of the array

    ```
    signal_fft = fftshift(signal_fft);
    ```

5. Take the absolute value

    ```
    signal_fft = abs(signal_fft);
    ```

6. Here since it is a 2D output, it can be plotted as an image. Hence, we use the imagesc function

    ```
    imagesc(signal_fft);
    ```


### 2D FFT Exercise

In the following exercise, you will practice the 2D FFT in MATLAB using some generated data. For this exercise, we are going to use the same data that we used in the 1D FFT exercise. However, the generated signal `X(t)` was 1D. In this exercise, we will reshape it to 2D for demonstrating the 2D FFT technique.
