## 1. Submitting Your Project

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/March/5c8599e3_obstacledetectionfps/obstacledetectionfps.gif)

Below is the workspace with your code from the previous lessons. At this point, you should be just about ready to submit the project! Be sure that you have implemented your own RANSAC, KD-Tree, and Euclidean clustering algorithms, as these are required as part of your processing pipeline. The quizzes in the previous lessons are a great resource for doing this! A project that uses PCL's built in segmentation and clustering functions will not pass, although those PCL functions can be useful for testing.


### Testing Your Project Before Submission

Before you submit the project, compile and run the project once more to ensure that everything is working correctly. You should see results that are similar to the .gif above: the road should be segmented from the vehicles, and there should boxes placed around the detected obstacles.

### Checking the Rubric

If your project works correctly and you are happy with the results, carefully look at the project rubric. If you feel like all the criteria from the rubric are met, you are ready to submit!


### Submitting the Project

You can submit your project using the "SUBMIT PROJECT" button in the terminal below. If you are developing the project locally, and you would prefer to submit using a .zip file or Github repo, proceed to the next concept.

Check your project carefully against the rubric [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2529/view).

#### Obstacle Detection

More robust methods for plane fitting are usually sought in practice compared to what you've done in class. Take a look at [this method](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/5/433/pdf) in particular for more details.

Have a look at [this resource](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) in particular that performs fast incremental kd-tree updates. In addition, this resource has faster methods for downsampling and bounding box operations in 3D points.
