## 13. The PCL Viewer

### PCL Viewer Overview

**In `environment.cpp` a pcl viewer is created. The viewer is used to handle all your visualization of objects on the screen.** Some functions that use the pcl viewer inside `environment.cpp` are `initCamera` and `initHighway`. **The `initCamera` function helps you set up different viewing angles in your window.** There are four different options: XY, TopDown, Side, and FPS. XY gives a 45 degree angle view, while FPS is First Person Sense and gives the sensation of being in the car’s driver seat.

**Also, the functions from `render` heavily use the viewer as well.** *You might notice that viewer is usually passed in as a reference. That way the process is more streamlined because something doesn't need to get returned.*

## 15. Creating the Lidar Object

### Creating the Lidar Object

{% include video id="mU1kp4FXdVg" provider="youtube" %}

**The first thing you are going to do is create a lidar object.** *The lidar object is defined by the `src/sensors/lidar.h` header file which is included at the top of `environment.cpp`.* **Also in `environment.cpp` is the `simpleHighway` function**, which takes a reference argument for the PCL visualizer viewer that was discussed previously.


### Exercise Instructions

**You will instantiate a pointer to a `Lidar` object in the `simpleHighway` function.** You should create the `Lidar` pointer object on the heap, using the new keyword. **The `Lidar` constructor takes two arguments: `cars` and the slope of the ground** - these arguments are necessary for modeling ray collisions. The `Lidar` object should be created with a slope of 0.


## Note

**The lidar arguments are necessary for modeling ray collisions.** *The Lidar object is going to be holding point cloud data which could be very large.* By instatinating on the heap, we have more memory to work with than the 2MB on the stack. However, it takes longer to look up objects on the heap, while stack lookup is very fast.

## 16. Using the Lidar Object

### Using the Lidar Object

{% include video id="auAPb-NC2Xo" provider="youtube" %}

To go further with your newly created `Lidar` object, check out `src/sensors/lidar.h` to see how everything is defined. In this header file, you can see the `ray` object being defined. **`Lidar` will use these `ray`s to sense its surrounding by doing ray casting.** *The `scan` function from the lidar struct will be what is doing the ray casting.*

**Now let's call the lidar `scan` function and see how lidar rays look.** Back in your `environment` file, right after the call to the `Lidar` constructor, you can use the `scan` function and then render the lidar rays.

### Exercise

- To create a point cloud, call the lidar `scan()` method on your `lidar` object.
- You will store results in a `PointCloud` pointer object, `pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr`
- The type of point for the `PointCloud` will be `pcl::PointXYZ`.
- Call the `renderRays` function with generated `PointCloud` pointer.


### Note

The syntax of `PointCloud` with the [template](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/) is similar to the syntax of vectors or other std container libraries: `ContainerName<ObjectName>`.

**The `Ptr` type from `PointCloud` indicates that the object is actually a pointer** - a 32 bit integer that contains the memory address of your point cloud object. Many functions in pcl use point cloud pointers as arguments, so it's convenient to return the `inputCloud` in this form.

The `renderRays` function is defined in `src/render`. **It contains functions that allow us to render points and shapes to the pcl viewer.** *You will be using it to render your lidar rays as line segments in the viewer.*

The arguments for the `renderRays` function is viewer, which gets passed in by reference. This means that any changes to the viewer in the body of the `renderRays` function directly affect the viewer outside the function scope. The lidar position also gets passed in, as well as the point cloud that your scan function generated. *The type of point for the `PointCloud` will be `pcl::PointXYZ`.* **We will talk about some other different types of point clouds in a bit.**

## 17. Templates and Different Point Cloud Data

### Templates and Different Point Cloud Data

{% include video id="3Hws520ZZGw" provider="youtube" %}


### Why Use Templates?

The lidar scan function used previously produced a pcl `PointCloud` object with `pcl::PointXYZ` points. The object uses a [template](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/templates/) because there are many different types of point clouds: some that are 3D, some that are 2D, some that include color and intensity. Here you are working with plain 3D point clouds so PointXYZ is used. However, later in the course you will have points with an intensity component as well.

Instead of defining two separate functions one with an argument for PointXYZ and the other for PointXYZI, templates can automate this process. With templates, you only have to write the function once and use the template like an argument to specify the point type.


### Templates and Pointers

If you haven’t used templates with pointers before, you may have noticed in the code that `typename` is used whenever a pointer is used that depends on a template. For example in the function signature here:

```c++
typename pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr ProcessPointClouds<PointT>::FilterCloud(typename pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr cloud, float filterRes, Eigen::Vector4f minPoint, Eigen::Vector4f maxPoint)
```

The reason for this is the following: Given a piece of code with a type name parameter, like `pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr`, the compiler is unable to determine if the code is a value or a type without knowing the value for the type name parameter. The compiler will assume that the code represents a value. If the code actually represents a typename, you will need to specify that.

Test your own intuition with the quiz below. You can use this [documentation](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/classpcl_1_1_point_cloud.html) for help.


### QUIZ QUESTION

- **Q.** Is `pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr` a value or a type?

- **A.** type

## 18. Adjusting Lidar Parameters

### Adjusting Lidar Parameters

{% include video id="TwySby8ZZ3k" provider="youtube" %}

You can orbit and move around the scene to see the different rays that are being cast. The current lidar settings will limit what you can do, however. The resolution is low, and as you can see from the scene, only one of the rays is touching a car. So The next task for you will be to increase your lidar's resolution so you can clearly see the other cars around. To do this, follow the instructions from the TODO statements in lidar.h.

The changes include increasing the minimum distance so you don't include contact points from the roof of your car, increasing both the horizontal and vertical angle resolution, and finally, adding noise. The noise you will be adding is actually quite high since units are meters, but it will yield more interesting and realistic point data in the scene. Also feel completely free to experiment and play around with these lidar hyper parameters!


### Exercise

- Now you will increase lidar resolution by increasing the number of vertical layers and the angular resolution around the z-axis.
    - numLayers should change from 3 to 8.
    - horizontalLayerIncrement should change from pi/6 to pi/64.
- Set minDistance to 5 (meters) to remove points from your vehicle's roof.
- Add noise, around 0.2 to get a more interesting pcd.

When you are finished with the exercise, your output should look like the image below.

## 19. Examining the Point Cloud

{% include video id="_soZXKanuBk" provider="youtube" %}

Now that you can see what the lidar rays look like, what about the actual point cloud data that you will be using and processing? You can view the point cloud data using the renderPointCloud function in render. You can also choose to turn off the rendering for the highway scene so you can see what the point cloud looks like by itself.

The result in the image above is without noise and with lidar minDistance set to zero. With a high lidar minDistance, you can remove the points above that are hitting the roof of your car, since these won't help you detect other cars. Also, some noise variance helps to create more interesting looking point clouds. Additionally, adding noise will help you to develop more robust point processing functions.


### Exercise

Now you will view the lidar's point cloud by itself, without the rays.

- To do this, call renderPointCloud instead of renderRays in the simpleHighway function.
- You can also view the point cloud without obstacles by setting renderScene to false in environment.cpp.

When you are finished, your output should look like the image below.
