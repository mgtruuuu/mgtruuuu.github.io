## 2. The CTRV Model

### Motion Models and Kalman Filters

In the extended kalman filter lesson, we used a **constant velocity model** (**CV**). A constant velocity model is one of the most basic motion models used with object tracking.

But there are many other models including:

- **constant turn rate and velocity magnitude model** (**CTRV**)
- constant turn rate and acceleration (CTRA)
- constant steering angle and velocity (CSAV)
- constant curvature and acceleration (CCA)

Each model makes different assumptions about an object's motion. In this lesson, you will work with the CTRV model.

Keep in mind that you can use any of these motion models with either the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter, but we wanted to expose you to more than one motion model.


### Limitations of the Constant Velocity (CV) Model

### QUIZ

- Q. Assume a vehicle drives straight at first and then goes into a turn. If we apply a Kalman Filter to track the vehicle (using the process model from the last lesson, which assumes constant velocity), what do you expect to happen with our estimation result for the vehicle position?

- A. The process model would assume the car is moving tangentially to the circle, resulting in a predicted position outside of the actually driven circle.

In the following quizzes, you'll be using state vectors to draw qualitative observations about the motion of turning objects.
