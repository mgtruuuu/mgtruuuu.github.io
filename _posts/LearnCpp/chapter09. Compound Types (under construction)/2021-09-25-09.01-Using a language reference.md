## Overview

Cppreference greets you with an overview of the core language and libraries:

![overview-min](https://www.learncpp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/images/CppTutorial/cppreference/overview-min.png)

From here, you can get to everything cppreference has to offer, but it’s easier to use the search function, or a search engine. The overview is a great place to visit once you’ve finished the tutorials on LearnCpp.com, to delve deeper into the libraries, and to see what else the language has to offer that you might not be aware of.

The upper half of the table shows features currently in the language, while the bottom half shows technical specifications, which are features that may or may not be added to C++ in a future version, or have already been partially accepted into the language. This can be useful if you want to see what new capabilities are coming soon.

Starting with C++11, cppreference marks all features with the language standard version they’ve been added in. The standard version is the little green number you can see next to some of the links in the above image. Features without a version number have been available since C++98/03. The version numbers are not only in the overview, but everywhere on cppreference, letting you know exactly what you can or cannot use in a specific C++ version.


>**A reminder**  
The C++ versions are C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. C++23 is the informal name for the next planned iteration.

>**Warning**  
If you use a search engine and a technical specification has just been accepted into the standard, you might get linked to a technical specification rather than the official reference, which can differ.

>**Tip**  
Cppreference is not only a reference for C++, but also for C. Since C++ shares some functions with C (which can differ), you may find yourself in the C reference after searching for something. The URL and the navigation bar at the top of cppreference always show you if you’re browsing the C or C++ reference.
