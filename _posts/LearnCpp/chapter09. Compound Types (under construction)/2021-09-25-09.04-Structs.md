Fortunately, C++ allows us to create our own user-defined aggregate data types. An **aggregate data type** is a data type that groups multiple individual variables together. One of the simplest aggregate data types is the struct. A **struct** (short for structure) allows us to group variables of mixed data types together into a single unit.

## Declaring and defining structs

Because structs are user-defined, we first have to tell the compiler what our struct looks like before we can begin using it. To do this, we declare our struct using the *struct* keyword. Here is an example of a struct declaration:

```c++
struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};
```

This tells the compiler that we are defining a struct named Employee. The Employee struct contains 3 variables inside of it: an int named id, an int named age, and a double named wage. These variables that are part of the struct are called **members** (or **fields**). Keep in mind that Employee is just a declaration -- even though we are telling the compiler that the struct will have member variables, *no memory* is allocated at this time. By convention, struct names start with a capital letter to distinguish them from variable names.

>**Warning**  
One of the easiest mistakes to make in C++ is to forget the semicolon at the end of a struct declaration. This will cause a compiler error on the *next* line of code. Modern compilers like Visual Studio 2010 will give you an indication that you may have forgotten a semicolon, but older or less sophisticated compilers may not, which can make the actual error hard to find.

In order to use the Employee struct, we simply declare a variable of type Employee:

```c++
Employee joe; // struct Employee is capitalized, variable joe is not
```

This defines a variable of type Employee named joe. As with normal variables, defining a struct variable allocates memory for that variable.

It is possible to define multiple variables of the same struct type:

```c++
Employee joe; // create an Employee struct for Joe
Employee frank; // create an Employee struct for Frank
```


## Accessing struct members

When we define a variable such as Employee joe, joe refers to the entire struct (which contains the member variables). In order to access the individual members, we use the **member selection operator** (which is a period). Here is an example of using the member selection operator to assign values to each member variable:

```c++
Employee joe; // create an Employee struct for Joe
joe.id = 14; // assign a value to member id within struct joe
joe.age = 32; // assign a value to member age within struct joe
joe.wage = 24.15; // assign a value to member wage within struct joe

Employee frank; // create an Employee struct for Frank
frank.id = 15; // assign a value to member id within struct frank
frank.age = 28; // assign a value to member age within struct frank
frank.wage = 18.27; // assign a value to member wage within struct frank
```

As with normal variables, struct member variables are not initialized by default, and will typically contain junk. We must initialize or assign values to them manually.


## Initializing structs

Initializing structs by assigning values member by member is a little cumbersome, so C++ supports a faster way to initialize structs using an **initializer list**. This allows you to initialize some or all the members of a struct at declaration time.

```c++
struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

// joe.id = 1, joe.age = 32, joe.wage = 60000.0
Employee joe{ 1, 32, 60000.0 }; 

// frank.id = 2, frank.age = 28,
// frank.wage = 0.0 (default initialization)
Employee frank{ 2, 28 }; 
```

## Non-static member initialization

```c++
struct Rectangle {
    double length{ 1.0 };
    double width{ 1.0 };
};

int main() {
    Rectangle x; // length = 1.0, width = 1.0

    x.length = 2.0; // you can assign other values like normal
}
```

If both non-static member initializer and list-initialization are provided, the list-initialization takes precedence.

```c++
struct Rectangle {
    double length{ 1.0 };
    double width{ 1.0 };
};

int main() {

    // Rectangle x would be initialized with length and width 2.0.
    Rectangle x{ 2.0, 2.0 };
}
```

We talk about what **static members** are in a later chapter. For now, don’t worry about them.


## Assigning to structs

If we wanted to assign values to the members of structs, we can to do so individually:

```c++
struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

Employee joe;
joe.id = 1;
joe.age = 32;
joe.wage = 60000.0;
```

If you want to assign a new value to all members, this is a pain, particularly for structs with many members. You can also assign values to structs members using an initializer list:

```c++
struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

Employee joe;

joe = { 1, 32, 60000.0 };
// This is the same as
joe = Employee{ 1, 32, 60000.0 };

// It's also possible to copy all members
// from one variable to another
Employee emma{ joe };
```


## Structs and functions

A big advantage of using structs over individual variables is that we can pass the entire struct to a function that needs to work with the members:

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

void printInformation(Employee employee) {
    std::cout << "ID:   " << employee.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "Age:  " << employee.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "Wage: " << employee.wage << '\n';
}

int main() {
    Employee joe { 14, 32, 24.15 };
    Employee frank { 15, 28, 18.27 };

    // Print Joe's information
    printInformation(joe);

    std::cout << '\n';

    // Print Frank's information
    printInformation(frank);
}
```

In the above example, we pass an entire Employee struct to `printInformation()` (*by value*, meaning the argument is copied into the parameter). This prevents us from having to pass each variable individually. Furthermore, if we ever decide to add new members to our Employee struct, we will not have to change the function declaration or function call!

A function can also return a struct, which is one of the few ways to have a function return multiple variables.

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Point3d {
    double x{};
    double y{};
    double z{};
};

Point3d getZeroPoint() {
    // We can create a variable and return the variable.
    Point3d temp { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
    return temp;
}

Point3d getZeroPoint2() {
    // We can return directly. We already specified the type
    // at the function declaration (Point3d), so we don't need
    // it again here.
    return { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
}

Point3d getZeroPoint3() {
    // We can use empty curly braces to return a Point3d.
    // All non-static members with initializers will use those initializer values
    // All non-static non-initialized members will be zero-initialized
    return {};
}

int main() {
    Point3d zero{ getZeroPoint() };

    if (zero.x == 0.0 && zero.y == 0.0 && zero.z == 0.0)
        std::cout << "The point is zero\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The point is not zero\n";
    // "The point is zero"
}
```


## Nested structs

Structs can contain other structs. For example:

```c++
struct Employee {
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

struct Company {
    // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
    Employee CEO{}; 
    int numberOfEmployees{};
};

Company myCompany;
```

In this case, if we wanted to know what the CEO’s salary was, we simply use the member selection operator twice:  
```c++
myCompany.CEO.wage;
```

This selects the CEO member from myCompany, and then selects the wage member from within CEO.

You can use nested initializer lists for nested structs:

```c++
Company myCompany{ { 1, 42, 60000.0 }, 5 };
```


## Struct size and data structure alignment

Typically, the size of a struct is the sum of the size of all its members, but *not* always!

Consider the Employee struct, but with fixed-size integers and id being half the size of age. On many platforms, a double is 8 bytes, so we’d expect Employee to be 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 bytes. To find out the exact size of Employee, we can use the sizeof operator:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

struct Employee {
    // We're using fixed-width integers for the sake of the example.
    // Avoid them in real code.
    std::int16_t id{};
    std::int32_t age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main() {
    std::cout << "The size of a double is " << sizeof(double) << '\n';
    // "The size of a double is 8"

    std::cout << "The size of Employee is " << sizeof(Employee) << '\n';
    // "The size of Employee is 16"
}
```

It turns out, we can only say that the size of a struct will be *at least* as large as the size of all the variables it contains. But it could be larger! For performance reasons, the compiler will sometimes add gaps into structures (this is called **padding**).

In the Employee struct above, the compiler is invisibly adding 2 bytes of padding after member id, making the size of the structure 16 bytes instead of 14. The reason it does this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but readers who want to learn more can read about data structure alignment on Wikipedia. This is optional reading and not required to understand structures or C++!


## Accessing structs across multiple files

If you want to share a struct definition across multiple files (so you can instantiate variables of that struct type in multiple files), put the struct definition in a header file, and #include that header file anywhere you need it.

Struct variables are subject to the same rules as normal variables. Consequently, to make a struct variable accessible across multiple files, you can use the `extern` keyword in the declaration in the header and define the variable in a source file.


## Final notes on structs

Structs are very important in C++, as understanding structs is the first major step towards object-oriented programming! Later on in these tutorials, you’ll learn about another aggregate data type called a class, which is built on top of structs. Understanding structs well will help make the transition to classes that much easier.

The structs introduced in this lesson are sometimes called **plain old data structs** (or **POD structs**) since the members are all data (variable) members. In the future (when we discuss classes) we’ll talk about other kinds of members.

## Quiz time

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Fraction {
    int numerator{};
    int denominator{};
};

Fraction getFraction() {
    Fraction temp{};
    std::cout << "Enter a value for numerator: ";
    std::cin >> temp.numerator;
    std::cout << "Enter a value for denominator: ";
    std::cin >> temp.denominator;
    std::cout << '\n';
    return temp;
}

double multiply(Fraction f1, Fraction f2) {
    // Don't forget the static cast,
    // otherwise the compiler will do integer division!
    return (static_cast<double>(f1.numerator * f2.numerator) / (f1.denominator * f2.denominator));
}

int main() {
    // Allocate our first fraction
    const Fraction f1{ getFraction() };
    const Fraction f2{ getFraction() };

    const double result{ multiply(f1, f2) };

    std::cout << result << '\n';
}
```
