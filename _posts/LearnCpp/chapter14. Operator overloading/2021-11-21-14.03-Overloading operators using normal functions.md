In the previous lesson, we overloaded `operator+` as a friend function:

```c++
#include <iostream>

class Cents {
private:
    int m_cents{};

public:
    Cents(int cents) : m_cents{ cents } {}

    // Add Cents + Cents using a friend function.
    friend Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2);

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: This function is not a member function!
// Use the Cents constructor and operator+(int, int).
// We can access m_cents directly because this is a friend function.
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2) {
    return { c1.m_cents + c2.m_cents };
}

int main() {
    Cents cents1{ 6 };
    Cents cents2{ 8 };
    Cents centsSum{ cents1 + cents2 };
    std::cout << "I have " << centsSum.getCents() << " cents.\n";
}
```

Using a friend function to overload an operator is convenient because it gives you direct access to the internal members of the classes you’re operating on. In the initial `Cents` example above, our friend function version of `operator+` accessed member variable `m_cents` directly.

**However, if you don’t need that access, you can write your overloaded operators as normal functions.** Note that the `Cents` class above contains an access function (`getCents()`) that allows us to get at `m_cents` without having to have direct access to private members. Because of this, we can write our overloaded `operator+` as a non-friend:

```c++
#include <iostream>

class Cents {
private:
    int m_cents{};

public:
    Cents(int cents) : m_cents{ cents } {}

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: This function is not a member function 
//       nor a friend function!
// Use the Cents constructor and operator+(int, int).
// We don't need direct access to private members here.
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2) {
    return Cents{ c1.getCents() + c2.getCents() };
}

int main() {
    Cents cents1{ 6 };
    Cents cents2{ 8 };
    Cents centsSum{ cents1 + cents2 };
    std::cout << "I have "
        << centsSum.getCents() << " cents.\n";
}
```

Because the normal and friend functions work almost identically (they just have different levels of access to private members), we generally won’t differentiate them. *The one difference is that the friend function declaration inside the class serves as a prototype as well.* ***With the normal function version*, you’ll have to provide your own function prototype.**

`Cents.h`:

```c++
#ifndef CENTS_H
#define CENTS_H

class Cents {
private:
    int m_cents{};

public:
    Cents(int cents) : m_cents{ cents } {}

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// Need to explicitly provide prototype for operator+
// so uses of operator+ in other files know this overload exists.
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2);

#endif
```

`Cents.cpp`:

```c++
#include "Cents.h"

// note: This function is not a member function 
//       nor a friend function!
Cents operator+(const Cents& c1, const Cents& c2) {
    // Use the Cents constructor and operator+(int, int).
    // We don't need direct access to private members here.
    return { c1.getCents() + c2.getCents() };
}
```

`main.cpp`:

```c++
#include "Cents.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Cents cents1{ 6 };
    Cents cents2{ 8 };

    // Without the prototype in Cents.h, 
    // this would fail to compile.
    Cents centsSum{ cents1 + cents2 }; 
    std::cout << "I have " 
        << centsSum.getCents() << " cents.\n";
}
```

In general, a normal function should be preferred over a friend function if it’s possible to do so with the existing member functions available **(the less functions touching your classes’s internals, the better)**. *However, don’t add additional access functions just to overload an operator as a normal function instead of a friend function!*

>**Best practice**  
Prefer overloading operators as normal functions instead of friends if it’s possible to do so without adding additional functions.
