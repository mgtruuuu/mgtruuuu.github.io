Consider the following line of code:

```c++
int x = 5;
```

This statement uses copy initialization to initialize newly created integer variable `x` to the value of `5`.

However, classes are a little more complicated, since they use constructors for initialization. This lesson will examine topics related to copy initialization for classes.


## Copy initialization for classes

Given our `Fraction` class:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator;
    int m_denominator;

public:
    // Default constructor
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator(numerator), m_denominator(denominator) {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
    out << f1.m_numerator << "/" << f1.m_denominator;
    return out;
}
```

Consider the following:

```c++
int main() {
    Fraction six = Fraction(6);
    std::cout << six;   // "6/1"
}
```

**This form of copy initialization is evaluated the same way as the following:**

```c++
Fraction six(Fraction(6));
```

And as you learned in the previous lesson, *this can potentially make calls to both `Fraction(int, int)` and the `Fraction` copy constructor (which may be elided for performance reasons)*. However, because eliding isn’t guaranteed (prior to `C++17`, where elision in this particular case is now mandatory), **it’s better to avoid copy initialization for classes, and use uniform initialization instead**.

>**Best practice**  
Avoid using copy initialization, and use uniform initialization instead.


### Other places copy initialization is used

There are a few other places copy initialization is used, but two of them are worth mentioning explicitly. **When you *pass* or *return* a class by value, that process uses copy initialization.**

Consider:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator;
    int m_denominator;

public:
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator(numerator), m_denominator(denominator) {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    Fraction(const Fraction& copy) :
        m_numerator(copy.m_numerator), m_denominator(copy.m_denominator) {
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1);

    int getNumerator() { return m_numerator; }
    void setNumerator(int numerator) { m_numerator = numerator; }
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
    out << f1.m_numerator << "/" << f1.m_denominator;
    return out;
}

// Ideally we should do this by const reference.
Fraction makeNegative(Fraction f) {
    f.setNumerator(-f.getNumerator());

    return f;
}

int main() {
    Fraction fiveThirds(5, 3);

    std::cout << makeNegative(fiveThirds);
    // "Copy constructor called"
    // "Copy constructor called"
    // "-5/3"
}
```

*In the above program, function `makeNegative` takes a `Fraction` by value and also returns a `Fraction` by value.*

The first copy constructor call happens *when `fiveThirds` is passed as an argument into `makeNegative()` parameter `f`*. The second call happens *when the return value from `makeNegative()` is passed back to `main()`*.

*In the above case, both the argument passed by value and the return value cannot be elided.* **However, in other cases, if the argument or return value meet *specific criteria*, the compiler may opt to elide the copy constructor.** For example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
class Something {
public:
    Something() = default;
    Something(const Something&) {
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    }
};

Something foo() {
    // Copy constructor normally called here.
    return Something();     
}
Something goo() {
    Something s;

    // Copy constructor normally called here.
    return s;               
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Initializing s1\n";

    // Copy constructor normally called here.
    Something s1 = foo();   

    std::cout << "Initializing s2\n";

    // Copy constructor normally called here.
    Something s2 = goo();   
}
```

**The above program *would normally* call the copy constructor 4 times** -- however, due to copy elision, it’s likely that your compiler will elide most or all of the cases. Visual Studio 2019 elides 3 (it doesn’t elide the case where `s` is returned), and GCC elides all 4.
