Occasionally you may run into a case where you want to catch an exception, **but not want to (or have the ability to) *fully* handle it at the point where you catch it**. *This is common when you want to log an error, but pass the issue along to the caller to actually handle.*

When a function can use a return code, this is simple. Consider the following example:

```c++
Database* createDatabase(std::string filename) {
    try {
        Database* d = new Database(filename);

        // Assume this throws an int exception on failure.
        d->open();

        return d;
    }
    catch (int exception) {

        // Database creation failed.
        // Write an error to some global logfile.
        g_log.logError("Creation of Database failed");
    }

    return nullptr;
}
```

*In the above code snippet, the function is tasked with creating a `Database` object, opening the database, and returning the `Database` object.* In the case where something goes wrong (e.g. the wrong `filename` is passed in), the exception handler logs an error, and then reasonably returns a null pointer.

Now consider the following function:

```c++
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database* d, std::string table,
    std::string key) {

    assert(d);

    try {

        // Throws int exception on failure.
        return d->getIntValue(table, key);
    }
    catch (int exception) {

        // Write an error to some global logfile.
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");

        // However, we haven't actually handled this error.
        // So what do we do here?
    }
}
```

In the case where this function succeeds, it returns an integer value -- any integer value could be a valid value.

*But what about the case where something goes wrong with `getIntValue()`?* In that case, `getIntValue()` will throw an integer exception, which will be caught by the catch block in `getIntValueFromDatabase()`, which will log the error. **But then how do we tell the caller of `getIntValueFromDatabase()` that something went wrong?** *Unlike the top example, there isn’t a good return code we can use here (because any integer return value could be a valid one).*


## Throwing a new exception

One obvious solution is **to throw a new exception**.

```c++
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database* d, std::string table, std::string key) {
    assert(d);

    // Throws int exception on failure.
    try { return d->getIntValue(table, key); }
    catch (int exception) {

        // Write an error to some global logfile.
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");

        // Throw char exception 'q' up the stack
        // to be handled by caller of getIntValueFromDatabase().
        throw 'q';
    }
}
```

In the example above, the program catches the `int` exception from `getIntValue()`, logs the error, and then throws a new exception with char value `‘q’`. Although it may seem weird to throw an exception from a catch block, this is allowed. Remember, ***only exceptions thrown within a try block* are eligible to be caught**. This means that an exception thrown within a catch block will not be caught by the catch block it’s in. *Instead, it will be propagated up the stack to the caller.*

**The exception thrown from the catch block can be an exception of *any* type** -- it doesn’t need to be the same type as the exception that was just caught.


## Rethrowing an exception (the wrong way)

Another option is **to rethrow the same exception**. *One way to do this is as follows:*

```c++
int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database* d, std::string table, std::string key) {
    assert(d);

    // Throws int exception on failure.
    try { return d->getIntValue(table, key); }
    catch (int exception) {

        // Write an error to some global logfile.
        g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");

        throw exception;
    }
}
```

Although this works, this method has **a couple of downsides**. 

- First, this doesn’t throw the exact same exception as the one that is caught -- **rather, it throws a copy-initialized copy of variable `exception`**. *Although the compiler is free to elide the copy, it may not, so this could be less performant.*

- But significantly, consider what happens in the following case:

    ```c++
    int getIntValueFromDatabase(Database* d, std::string table, std::string key) {
        assert(d);

        // Throws Derived exception on failure.
        try { return d->getIntValue(table, key); }
        
        catch (Base& exception) {
            g_log.logError("doSomethingImportant failed");

            // danger! This throws a Base object, 
            // not a Derived object.
            throw exception;
        }
    }
    ```

    In this case, `getIntValue()` throws a `Derived` object, but the catch block is catching a `Base` reference. This is fine, as we know we can have a `Base` reference to a `Derived` object. However, when we throw exception, the thrown exception is copy-initialized from variable `exception`. Variable `exception` has type `Base`, ***so the copy-initialized `exception` also has type `Base` (not `Derived`!)***. In other words, our `Derived` object has been *sliced*!

    >>>???

    You can see this in the following program:

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    class Base {
    public:
        Base() {}
        virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
    };

    class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        Derived() {}
        virtual void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
    };

    int main() {
        try {
            try { throw Derived{}; }
            catch (Base& b) {
                std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
                b.print();
                std::cout << "\n";

                // The Derived object gets sliced here.
                throw b;
            }
        }
        catch (Base& b) {
            std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
            b.print();
            std::cout << "\n";
        }
    }
    ```

    This prints:

    ```
    Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
    Caught Base b, which is actually a Base
    ```

    *The fact that the second line indicates that `Base` is actually a `Base` rather than a `Derived` proves that the `Derived` object was sliced.*


## Rethrowing an exception (the right way)

**Fortunately, C++ provides a way to rethrow the exact same exception as the one that was just caught**. To do so, simply use the `throw` keyword from within the catch block (with no associated variable), like so:

```c++
#include <iostream>
class Base {
public:
    Base() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() {}
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Derived"; }
};

int main() {
    try {
        try { throw Derived{}; }
        catch (Base& b) {
            std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
            b.print();
            std::cout << "\n";

            // note: We're now rethrowing the object here.
            throw;
        }
    }
    catch (Base& b) {
        std::cout << "Caught Base b, which is actually a ";
        b.print();
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

This prints:

```
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
Caught Base b, which is actually a Derived
```

This `throw` keyword that doesn’t appear to throw anything in particular actually **re-throws the exact same exception that was just caught**. **No copies are made**, meaning we don’t have to worry about performance killing copies or slicing.

If rethrowing an exception is required, this method should be preferred over the alternatives.

>**Rule**  
When rethrowing the same exception, use the `throw` keyword by itself.
