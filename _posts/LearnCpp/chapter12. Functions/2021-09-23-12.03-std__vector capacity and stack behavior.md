In [lesson 10.23 -- An introduction to std::vector](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/an-introduction-to-stdvector/), we introduced `std::vector` and talked about how `std::vector` can be used as a dynamic array that both remembers its length and can be dynamically resized as required.

Although this is the most useful and commonly used part of `std::vector`, `std::vector` has some additional attributes and capabilities that make it useful in some other capacities as well.


## Length vs capacity

Consider the following example:

```c++
int* array{ new int[10] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } };
```

We would say that this array has a length of `10`, even though we’re only using `5` of the elements that we allocated.

*However, what if we only wanted to iterate over the elements we’ve initialized, reserving the unused ones for future expansion?* In that case, we’d need to separately track how many elements were “used” from how many elements were allocated. Unlike a built-in array or a `std::array`, which only remembers its length, **`std::vector` contains two separate attributes: *length* and *capacity***. In the context of a `std::vector`, **length is how many elements are being used in the array, whereas capacity is how many elements were allocated in memory**.

Taking a look at an example from the previous lesson on `std::vector`:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> array{ 0, 1, 2 };

    // Set length to 5.
    array.resize(5);

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';
    // "The length is: 5"

    for (auto element : array)
        std::cout << element << ' ';
    // "0 1 2 0 0"
}
```

In the above example, we’ve used the `resize()` function to set the vector’s length to `5`. This tells variable array that we’re intending to use the first `5` elements of the array, so it should consider those in active use. However, that leaves an interesting question: what is the capacity of this array?

We can ask the `std::vector` what its capacity is via the `capacity()` function:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> array{ 0, 1, 2 };

    // Set length to 5.
    array.resize(5);

    std::cout << "The length is: " << array.size() << '\n';
    // The length is: 5

    std::cout << "The capacity is: " << array.capacity() << '\n';
    // The capacity is: 5
}
```

In this case, the `resize()` function caused the `std::vector` to change both its length and capacity. **Note that the capacity is guaranteed to be at least as large as the array length** (but could be larger), otherwise accessing the elements at the end of the array would be outside of the allocated memory!


### More length vs. capacity

Why differentiate between length and capacity? `std::vector` will reallocate its memory if needed, but like Melville’s Bartleby, it would prefer not to, because resizing an array is computationally expensive. Consider the following:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> array{};

    // okay, array length = 5.
    array = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    std::cout << "length: " << array.size()
        << "  capacity: " << array.capacity() << '\n';
    // "length: 5  capacity: 5"

    // okay, array length is now 3!
    array = { 9, 8, 7 };
    std::cout << "length: " << array.size()
        << "  capacity: " << array.capacity() << '\n';
    // "length: 3  capacity: 5"
}
```

Note that although we assigned a smaller array to our vector, **it did not reallocate its memory** (the capacity is still `5`). It simply changed its length, so it knows that only the first `3` elements are valid at this time.


### Array subscripts and `at()` are based on length, not capacity

**The range for the subscript operator (`[]`) and `at()` function is based on *the vector’s length, not the capacity***. Consider the array in the previous example, which has length `3` and capacity `5`. What happens if we try to access the array element with index `4`? The answer is that it fails, since `4` is greater than the length of the array.

*Note that a vector will not resize itself based on a call to the subscript operator or `at()` function!*


## Stack behavior with `std::vector`

If the subscript operator and `at()` function are based on the array length, and the capacity is always at least as large as the array length, why even worry about the capacity at all? **Although `std::vector` can be used *as a dynamic array*, it can also be used *as a stack*.** To do this, we can use 3 functions that match our key stack operations:

- `push_back()` pushes an element on the stack.
- `back()` returns the value of the top element on the stack.
- `pop_back()` pops an element off the stack.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void printStack(const std::vector<int>& stack) {
    for (auto element : stack)
        std::cout << element << ' ';

    std::cout << "(cap " << stack.capacity()
        << " length " << stack.size() << ")\n";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> stack{};

    printStack(stack);

    // push_back() pushes an element on the stack.
    stack.push_back(5); 
    printStack(stack);

    stack.push_back(3);
    printStack(stack);

    stack.push_back(2);
    printStack(stack);

    // back() returns the last element.
    std::cout << "top: " << stack.back() << '\n'; 

    // pop_back() pops an element off the stack.
    stack.pop_back(); 
    printStack(stack);

    stack.pop_back();
    printStack(stack);

    stack.pop_back();
    printStack(stack);
}
```

This prints:

```
(cap 0 length 0)
5 (cap 1 length 1)
5 3 (cap 2 length 2)
5 3 2 (cap 3 length 3)
top: 2
5 3 (cap 3 length 2)
5 (cap 3 length 1)
(cap 3 length 0)
```

**Unlike array subscripts or `at()`, the stack-based functions will resize the `std::vector` if necessary.** In the example above, the vector gets resized 3 times (from a capacity of `0` to `1`, `1` to `2`, and `2` to `3`).

**Because resizing the vector is expensive, we can tell the vector to allocate a certain amount of capacity up front using the `reserve()` function:**

>>>Resizing the vector **with the capacity** is expensive ...

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

void printStack(const std::vector<int>& stack) {
    for (auto element : stack)
        std::cout << element << ' ';

    std::cout << "(cap " << stack.capacity()
        << " length " << stack.size() << ")\n";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> stack{};

    // Set the capacity to (at least) 5.
    stack.reserve(5); 

    printStack(stack);

    stack.push_back(5);
    printStack(stack);

    stack.push_back(3);
    printStack(stack);

    stack.push_back(2);
    printStack(stack);

    std::cout << "top: " << stack.back() << '\n';

    stack.pop_back();
    printStack(stack);

    stack.pop_back();
    printStack(stack);

    stack.pop_back();
    printStack(stack);
}
```

This program prints:

```c++
(cap 5 length 0)
5 (cap 5 length 1)
5 3 (cap 5 length 2)
5 3 2 (cap 5 length 3)
top: 2
5 3 (cap 5 length 2)
5 (cap 5 length 1)
(cap 5 length 0)
```

We can see that the capacity was preset to `5` and didn’t change over the lifetime of the program.


### Vectors may allocate extra capacity

**When a vector is resized, the vector may allocate more capacity than is needed.** This is done to provide some “breathing room” for additional elements, to minimize the number of resize operations needed. Let’s take a look at this:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    std::cout << "size: " << v.size()
        << "  cap: " << v.capacity() << '\n';

    // Add another element.
    v.push_back(5);
    std::cout << "size: " << v.size()
        << "  cap: " << v.capacity() << '\n';
}
```

On the author’s machine, this prints:

```c++
size: 5  cap: 5
size: 6  cap: 7
```

When we used `push_back()` to add a new element, our vector only needed room for 6 elements, but allocated room for 7. This was done so that if we were to `push_back()` another element, it wouldn’t need to resize immediately.

**If, when, and how much additional capacity is allocated is left *up to the compiler implementer*.**
