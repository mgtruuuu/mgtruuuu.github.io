In the prior lesson ([9.14 -- Unscoped enumerations](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/unscoped-enumerations/)), we mentioned that enumerators are symbolic constants. What we didn’t tell you then is that **enumerators are integral symbolic constants**. *As a result, enumerated types actually hold an integral value.*

*This is similar to the case with chars ([4.11 -- Chars](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chars/)).* Consider:

```c++
char ch{ 'A' };
```

A char is really just a 1-byte integral value, and the character 'A' gets converted to an integral value (in this case, 65) and stored.

**When we define an enumerator, each enumerator is automatically assigned an integer value based on its position in the enumerator list.** *By default, the first enumerator is assigned the integral value 0, and each subsequent enumerator has a value one greater than the previous enumerator:*

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Color {
    black,  // assigned 0
    red,    // assigned 1
    blue,   // assigned 2
    green,  // assigned 3
    white,  // assigned 4
    cyan,   // assigned 5
    yellow, // assigned 6
    magenta // assigned 7
};

// This actually stores the integral value 2.
int main() { Color shirt{ blue }; }
```

**It is possible to explicitly define the value of enumerators.** These integral values can be positive or negative, and can share the same value as other enumerators. Any non-defined enumerators are given a value one greater than the previous enumerator.

```c++
enum Animal {
    cat     = -3,
    dog,         // assigned -2
    pig,         // assigned -1
    horse   = 5,
    giraffe = 5, // Shares same value as horse.
    chicken      // assigned 6
};
```

Note in this case, `horse` and `giraffe` have been given the same value. **When this happens, the enumerators become non-distinct -- essentially, `horse` and `giraffe` are interchangeable.** *Although C++ allows it, assigning the same value to two enumerators in the same enumeration should generally be avoided.*

>**Best practice**  
Avoid assigning explicit values to your enumerators unless you have a compelling reason to do so.


## Unscoped enumerations will implicitly convert to integral values

Consider the following program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Color {
    black,  // assigned 0
    red,    // assigned 1
    blue,   // assigned 2
    green,  // assigned 3
    white,  // assigned 4
    cyan,   // assigned 5
    yellow, // assigned 6
    magenta // assigned 7
};

int main() {
    Color shirt{ blue };

    // What does this do?
    std::cout << "Your shirt is " << shirt;
}
```

Since enumerated types hold integral values, as you might expect, this prints:

```
Your shirt is 2
```

**When an enumerated type is used in a function call or with an operator, the compiler will first try to find a function or operator that matches the enumerated type.** For example, when the compiler tries to compile `std::cout << shirt`, the compiler will first look to see if `std::cout` knows how to print an object of type `Color` (because `shirt` is of type `Color`). It doesn’t.

**If the compiler can’t find a match, the compiler will then implicitly convert an unscoped enumeration or enumerator to its corresponding integer value.** Because `std::cout` does know how to print an integral value, the value in `shirt` gets converted to an integer and printed as integer value 2.


## Printing enumerator names

**Most of the time, printing an enumeration as an integral value (such as 2) isn’t what we want.** *Instead, we typically will want to print the name of whatever the enumerator represents (blue).* But to do that, we need some way to convert the integral value of the enumeration (2) into a string matching the enumerator name ("blue").

*As of `C++20`, C++ doesn’t come with any easy way to do this, so we’ll have to find a solution ourselves.* Fortunately, that’s not very difficult. **The typical way to do this is to write a function that takes an enumerated type as a parameter and then outputs the corresponding string (or returns the string to the caller).**

The typical way to do this is to test our enumeration against every possible enumerator:

```c++
// Using if-else for this is inefficient.
void printColor(Color color) {
    if      (color == black)    std::cout << "black";
    else if (color == red)      std::cout << "red";
    else if (color == blue)     std::cout << "blue";
    else                        std::cout << "???";
}
```

*However, using a series of if-else statements for this is inefficient, as it requires multiple comparisons before a match is found.* **A more efficient way to do the same thing is to use a switch statement.** *In the following example, we will also return our `Color` as a `std::string`, to give the caller more flexibility to do whatever they want with the name (including print it):*

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

enum Color { black, red, blue, };

// We'll show a better version of this for C++17 below.
std::string getColor(Color color) {
    switch (color) {
    case black:     return "black";
    case red:       return "red";
    case blue:      return "blue";
    default:        return "???";
    }
}

int main() {
    Color shirt{ blue };

    std::cout << "Your shirt is "
        << getColor(shirt) << '\n';
}
```

This prints:

```
Your shirt is blue
```

This likely performs better than the if-else chain (switch statements tend to be more efficient than if-else chains), and it’s easier to read too. *However, this version is still inefficient, because we need to create and return a `std::string` (which is expensive) every time the function is called.*

*In `C++17`, a more efficient option is to replace `std::string` with `std::string_view`.* **`std::string_view` allows us to return string literals in a way that is much less expensive to copy.**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>  // since C++17

enum Color { black, red, blue, };

constexpr std::string_view getColor(Color color) {
    switch (color) {
    case black:     return "black";
    case red:       return "red";
    case blue:      return "blue";
    default:        return "???";
    }
}

int main() {
    Color shirt{ blue };

    std::cout << "Your shirt is "
        << getColor(shirt) << '\n';
}
```

We haven’t covered `std::string_view` yet, but we do so in future [lesson 10.7 -- An introduction to std::string_view](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/an-introduction-to-stdstring_view/). For now, it’s fine to use in this specific context.


## Teaching `std::cout` how to print an enumerator

*Although the above example functions well, we still have to remember the name of the function we created to get the enumerator name.* While this usually isn’t too burdensome, it can become more problematic if you have lots of enumerations. **Using operator overloading (a capability similar to function overloading), we can actually teach `std::cout` how to print the value of a program-defined enumeration!** We haven’t explained how this works yet, so consider it a bit of magic for now:

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Color { black, red, blue, };

// Teach std::cout how to print a Color.
// Consider this magic for now 
// since we haven't explained any of the concepts it uses yet.
// std::ostream is the type of std::cout.
// The return type and parameter type are references
// (to prevent copies from being made)!
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, Color color) {
    switch (color) {
    case black:     out << "black";  break;
    case red:       out << "red";    break;
    case blue:      out << "blue";   break;
    default:        out << "???";    break;
    }

    return out;
}

int main() {
    Color shirt{ blue };

    // it works!
    std::cout << "Your shirt is " << shirt;
}
```

This prints:

```
Your shirt is blue
```

>**For advanced readers**  
For the curious, here’s what the above code is actually doing. When we try to print `shirt` using `std::cout` and `operator<<`, the compiler will see that we’ve overloaded `operator<<` to work with objects of type `Color`. This overloaded `operator<<` function is then called with `std::cout` as the `out` parameter, and our `shirt` as parameter `color`. Since `out` is a reference to `std::cout`, a statement such as `out << "blue"` is really just printing "blue" to `std::cout`.

We cover overloading the I/O operators in [lesson 13.4 -- Overloading the I/O operators](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/overloading-the-io-operators/). For now, you can copy this code and replace `Color` with your own enumerated type.


## Enumeration size and base

**Enumerated types are considered part of the integer family of types, and it’s up to the compiler to determine how much memory to allocate for an enum variable.** *The C++ standard says the enum size needs to be large enough to represent all of the enumerator values. Most often, it will make enum variables the same size as a standard `int`.*

**However, it is possible to specify a different underlying type.** For example, if you are working in some bandwidth-sensitive context (e.g. sending data over a network) you may want to specify a smaller type:

```c++
// Use an 8-bit unsigned integer as the enum base.
enum Color : std::uint8_t { black, red, blue, };
```

**Since enumerators aren’t usually used for arithmetic or comparisons with integers, it’s generally safe to use an unsigned integer if desired.**

>**Best practice**  
Specify the base type of an enumeration only when necessary.


## Integer to unscoped enumerator conversion

While the compiler will implicitly convert unscoped enumerators to an integer, **it will not implicitly convert an integer to an unscoped enumerator**. The following will produce a compiler error:

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Pet {
    cat,    // assigned 0
    dog,    // assigned 1
    pig,    // assigned 2
    whale,  // assigned 3
};

int main() {

    //// compile error!
    //// Integer value 2 won't implicitly convert to a Pet.
    //Pet pet{ 2 };

    //// compile error!
    //// Integer value 1 won't implicitly convert to a Pet.
    //pet = 3;
}
```

**There are two ways to work around this.**

- *First, you can force the compiler to convert an integer to an unscoped enumerator using `static_cast`:*

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>

    enum Pet { cat, dog, pig, whale, };

    int main() {

        // Convert integer 2 to a Pet.
        Pet pet{ static_cast<Pet>(2) };

        // our pig evolved into a whale!
        pet = static_cast<Pet>(3);
    }
    ```

    We’ll see an example in a moment where this can be useful.

- *Second, in `C++17`, if an unscoped enumeration has a specified base, then the compiler will allow you to initialize (but not assign) an unscoped enumeration using an integral value:*

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>

    // We've specified a base.
    enum Pet : int { cat, dog, pig, whale, };

    int main() {

        // ok: Can initialize with integer.
        Pet pet{ 2 };

        //// compile error! Cannot assign with integer.
        //pet = 3;
    }
    ```


## Unscoped enumerator input

**Because `Pet` is a program-defined type, the language doesn’t know how to input a `Pet` using `std::cin`:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Pet { cat, dog, pig, whale, };

int main() {
    Pet pet{ pig };

    //// compile error! 
    //// std::cin doesn't know how to input a Pet.
    //std::cin >> pet;
}
```

To work around this, we can read in an integer, and use `static_cast` to convert the integer to an enumerator of the appropriate enumerated type:

```c++
#include <iostream>

enum Pet { cat, dog, pig, whale, };

int main() {
    std::cout << "Enter a pet (0=cat, 1=dog, 2=pig, 3=whale): ";

    // Input an integer.
    int input{};
    std::cin >> input;

    // Static_cast our integer to a Pet.
    Pet pet{ static_cast<Pet>(input) };
}
```


## Quiz time

### Question #1

- **Q.** Enumerators can be initialized with the value of prior enumerators (e.g. `magenta` = `red`)

- **A.** True. Since enumerators evaluate to integers, and integers can be assigned to enumerators, enumerators can be initialized with other enumerators (though there is typically little reason to do so!).
