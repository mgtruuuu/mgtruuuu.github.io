## The address-of operator (`&`)


## The dereference operator (`*`)


## Pointers

A **pointer** is an object that holds a memory address (typically of another variable) as its value. This allows us to store the address of some other object to use later.

>**As an aside…**  
In modern C++, the pointers we are talking about here are sometimes called “raw pointers” or “dumb pointers”, to help differentiate them from “smart pointers” that were introduced into the language more recently. We cover smart pointers in [chapter M](https://www.learncpp.com/#ChapterM).

## Pointers and assignment


## Pointers behave much like lvalue references


## The address-of operator returns a pointer
