Consider the following program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';
}
```

When the definition for `x` is executed, the initialization value 5 is copied into the memory allocated for int `x`. For fundamental types, initializing (or copying) a variable is fast.

Now consider this similar program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string s{ "Hello, world!" };
    std::cout << s << '\n';
}
```

**When `s` is initialized, the C-style string literal `"Hello, world!"` is copied into memory allocated for `std::string` `s`.** Unlike fundamental types, **initializing (or copying) a `std::string` is slow.**

In the above program, all we do with `s` is print the value to the console, and then `s` is destroyed. We’ve essentially made a copy of “Hello, world!” just to print and then destroy that copy. That’s inefficient.

We see something similar in this example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void printString(std::string str) {
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::string s{ "Hello, world!" };
    printString(s);
}
```

**This example makes two copies of the C-style string `“Hello, world!”`:** one when we initialize `s` in `main()`, and another when we initialize parameter `str` in `printString()`. That’s a lot of needless copying just to print a string!


## std::string_view (C++17)

To address the issue with `std::string` being expensive to initialize (or copy), `C++17` introduced `std::string_view` (which lives in the `<string_view>` header). **`std::string_view` provides read-only access to an existing string (a C-style string literal, a `std::string`, or a char array) without making a copy.**

The following example is identical to the prior one, except we’ve replaced `std::string` with `std::string_view`.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

void printSV(std::string_view str) {        // now a std::string_view 
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::string_view s{ "Hello, world!" };  // now a std::string_view
    printSV(s);
}
```

**This program produces the same output as the prior one, but no copies of the string `“Hello, world!”` are made.**

When we initialize `std::string_view` `s` with C-style string literal `"Hello, world!"`, `s` provides read-only access to `“Hello, world!”` without making a copy of the string. When we pass `s` to `printSV()`, parameter `str` is initialized from `s`. This allows us to access `“Hello, world!”` through `str`, again without making a copy of the string.

>**Best practice**  
Prefer `std::string_view` over `std::string` when you need a read-only string, especially for function parameters.


## constexpr std::string_view

**Unlike `std::string`, `std::string_view` has full support for constexpr:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    constexpr std::string_view s{ "Hello, world!" };

    // s will be replaced with "Hello, world!" at compile-time.
    std::cout << s << '\n'; 
}
```


## Converting a std::string to a std::string_view

**A `std::string_view` can be created using a `std::string` initializer, and a `std::string` will implicitly convert to a `std::string_view`:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

void printSV(std::string_view str) {
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::string s{ "Hello, world" };

    // Initialize a std::string_view from a std::string.
    std::string_view sv{ s }; 
    std::cout << sv << '\n';

    // Implicitly convert a std::string to std::string_view.
    printSV(s); 
}
```


## Converting a std::string_view to a std::string

***Because `std::string` makes a copy of its initializer,*** C++ won’t allow implicit conversion of a `std::string` from a `std::string_view`. **However, we can explicitly create a `std::string` with a `std::string_view` initializer, or we can convert an existing `std::string_view` to a `std::string` using `static_cast`:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

void printString(std::string str) {
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

int main() {
    std::string_view sv{ "balloon" };

    // okay, we can create std::string using std::string_view initializer.
    std::string str{ sv }; 

    // compile error! Won't implicitly convert std::string_view to a std::string.
    //printString(sv);   

    // okay, we can explicitly cast a std::string_view to a std::string.
    printString(static_cast<std::string>(sv));  
}
```


## Literals for std::string_view

Double-quoted string literals are C-style string literals by default. **We can create string literals with type `std::string_view` by using a `sv` suffix after the double-quoted string literal.**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>      
#include <string_view> 

int main() {

    // easiest way to access the s and sv suffixes
    using namespace std::literals;  

    std::cout << "foo\n";       // no suffix is a C-style string literal
    std::cout << "goo\n"s;      // s suffix is a std::string literal
    std::cout << "moo\n"sv;     // sv suffix is a std::string_view literal
};
```

>**Tip**  
The “sv” suffix lives in the namespace `std::literals::string_view_literals`. The easiest way to access the literal suffixes is via using directive `using namespace std::literals`. We discuss using directives in [lesson 6.12 -- Using declarations and using directives](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/using-declarations-and-using-directives/). This is one of the exception cases where using an entire namespace is okay.


## Do not return a std::string_view

Returning a `std::string_view` from a function is usually a bad idea. We’ll explore why in [lesson 11.7 -- std::string_view (part 2)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/stdstring_view-part-2/). For now, avoid doing so.













**[`std::string`](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/an-introduction-to-stdstring/) has some of its own downsides, particularly when it comes to *const* strings.**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    char text[]{ "hello" };
    std::string str{ text };
    std::string more{ str };

    std::cout << text << ' ' << str << ' ' << more << '\n';
}
```

**Internally, `main` copies the string “hello” 3 times, resulting in 4 copies.** First, there is the string literal “hello”, *which is known at compile-time and stored in the binary*. One copy is created *when we create the `char[]`*. The following two `std::string` objects create one copy of the string each. **Because `std::string` is designed to be modifiable, each `std::string` must contain its own copy of the string, so that a given `std::string` can be modified without affecting any other `std::string` object.**

**This holds true for `const std::string`**, even though they can’t be modified.


## Introducing `std::string_view`

Consider a window in your house, looking at a car sitting on the street. You can look through the window and see the car, but you can’t touch or move the car. Your window just provides a view to the car, which is a completely separate object.

`C++17` introduces another way of using strings, `std::string_view`, which lives in the `<string_view>` header.

Unlike `std::string`, which keeps its own copy of the string, **`std::string_view` provides a view of a string that is defined elsewhere**.

We can re-write the above code to use `std::string_view` by replacing every `std::string` with `std::string_view`.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>      // for std::string_view

int main() {
    std::string_view text{ "hello" }; // view the text "hello", which is stored in the binary
    std::string_view str{ text };     // view of the same "hello"
    std::string_view more{ str };     // view of the same "hello"

    std::cout << text << ' ' << str << ' ' << more << '\n';
}
```

The output is the same, **but no more copies of the string “hello” are created**. **The string “hello” is stored in the binary and is *not allocated at run-time*.** `text` is only a view onto the string “hello”, so no copy has to be created. **When we copy a `std::string_view`, the new `std::string_view` observes the same string as the copied-from `std::string_view` is observing.** This means that neither `str` nor more create any copies. They are views onto the existing string “hello”.

**`std::string_view` is not only fast, but has many of the functions that we know from `std::string`.**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    std::string_view str{ "Trains are fast!" };

    std::cout << str.length() << '\n';                    // "16"
    std::cout << str.substr(0, str.find(' ')) << '\n';    // "Trains"
    std::cout << (str == "Trains are fast!") << '\n';     // "1"

    // Since C++20
    std::cout << str.starts_with("Boats") << '\n';        // "0"
    std::cout << str.ends_with("fast!") << '\n';          // "1"

    std::cout << str << '\n';               // "Trains are fast!"
}
```

Because `std::string_view` doesn’t create a copy of the string, **if we change the viewed string, the changes are reflected in the `std::string_view`**.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    char arr[]{ "Gold" };
    std::string_view str{ arr };

    std::cout << str << '\n'; // "Gold"

    // Change 'd' to 'f' in arr
    arr[3] = 'f';

    std::cout << str << '\n'; // "Golf"
}
```

We modified `arr`, but `str` appears to be changing as well. That’s because `arr` and `str` share their string. When you use a `std::string_view`, it’s best to avoid modifications to the underlying string for the remainder of the `std::string_view`’s life to prevent confusion and errors.

>**Best practice**  
- Use `std::string_view` instead of C-style strings.  
- Prefer `std::string_view` over `std::string` for read-only strings, unless you already have a `std::string`.


## View modification functions

Back to our window analogy, consider a window with curtains. We can close either the left or right curtain to reduce what we can see. We don’t change what’s outside, we just reduce the visible area.

Similarly, `std::string_view` contains functions that let us manipulate the view of the string. **This allows us to change the view without modifying the viewed string.**

The functions for this are **`remove_prefix`**, which removes characters from the left side of the view, and **`remove_suffix`**, which removes characters from the right side of the view.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    std::string_view str{ "Peach" };

    std::cout << str << '\n';     // "Peach"

    // Ignore the first character.
    str.remove_prefix(1);

    std::cout << str << '\n';     // "each"

    // Ignore the last 2 characters.
    str.remove_suffix(2);

    std::cout << str << '\n';     // "ea"
}
```

Unlike real curtains, **a `std::string_view` cannot be opened back up**. *Once you change the visible area, you can’t go back (There are tricks which we won’t go into)*.


## `std::string_view` works with non-null-terminated strings

**Unlike C-style strings and `std::string`, `std::string_view` doesn’t use null terminators to mark the end of the string.** *Rather, it knows where the string ends because it keeps track of its length.*

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>     // For std::size
#include <string_view>

int main() {

    // No null-terminator.
    char vowels[]{ 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };

    // vowels isn't null-terminated
    // so we need to pass the length manually.
    // Because vowels is an array,
    // we can use std::size to get its length.
    std::string_view str{ vowels, std::size(vowels) };

    // This is safe.
    // std::cout knows how to print std::string_views.
    std::cout << str << '\n'; // "aeiou"
}
```

>>>`std::string` owns the string. Whatever you initialize a `std::string` with, the `std::string` copies it. When you initialize a `std::string` with a non-null terminated char array, the `std::string` copies it.  
***There is no way to access a `std::string` such that it does not appear like a null-terminated string.*** While it is possible (At least I can't find a contradiction) for a standard library implementation not to use a null-terminated string internally, doing so wouldn't make sense.  
When you initialize the `std::string` with a non-null terminated char array, **the `std::string` appends the null-terminator to its internal string**. **Additionally `std::string` has to track the length.**


## Ownership issues

**Being only a view, a `std::string_view`’s lifetime is independent of that of the string it is viewing. If the viewed string goes out of scope, `std::string_view` has nothing to observe and accessing it causes undefined behavior.** The string that a `std::string_view` is viewing has to have been created somewhere else. It might be a string literal that lives as long as the program does or **it was created by a `std::string`, in which case the string lives until the `std::string` decides to destroy it or the `std::string` dies**. *`std::string_view` can’t create any strings on its own, because it’s just a view.*

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

std::string_view askForName() {
    std::cout << "What's your name?\n";

    // Use a std::string,
    // because std::cin needs to modify it.
    std::string str{};
    std::cin >> str;

    // We're switching to std::string_view
    // for demonstrative purposes only.
    // If you already have a std::string,
    // there's no reason to switch to a std::string_view.
    std::string_view view{ str };

    std::cout << "Hello " << view << '\n';

    return view;

}   // str dies, and so does the string that str created.

int main() {
    std::string_view view{ askForName() };

    // view is observing a string that already died.
    std::cout << "Your name is " << view << '\n'; 
    // Undefined behavior! ("Your name is �P@�P@")
}
```

In function `askForName()`, we create `str` and fill it with data from `std::cin`. Then we create `view`, which can view that string. At the end of the function, we return `view`, but the string it is viewing (`str`) is destroyed, so `view` is now pointing to deallocated memory. The function returns a dangling `std::string_view`.

Accessing the returned `std::string_view` in `main` causes undefined behavior, which on the author’s machine produced weird characters.

The same can happen when we create a `std::string_view` from a `std::string` and then modify the `std::string`. **Modifying a `std::string` can cause its internal string to die and be replaced with a new one *in a different place*.** The `std::string_view` will still look at where the old string was, but it’s not there anymore.

>**Warning**  
Make sure that the underlying string viewed with a `std::string_view` does not go out of scope and isn’t modified while using the `std::string_view`.


## Converting a `std::string_view` to a `std::string`

**An `std::string_view` will not implicitly convert to a `std::string`, but can be *explicitly* converted:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

void print(const std::string& s) { std::cout << s << '\n'; }

int main() {
    std::string_view sv{ "balloon" };

    sv.remove_suffix(3);

    // compile error! Won't implicitly convert.
    print(sv); 


    std::string str{ sv };                  // okay
    print(str);                             // okay ("ball")
    print(static_cast<std::string>(sv));    // okay ("ball")
}
```


## Converting a `std::string_view` to a C-style string

Some old functions (such as the old `strlen` function) still expect C-style strings. To convert a `std::string_view` to a C-style string, **we can do so by first converting to a `std::string`**:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    std::string_view sv{ "balloon" };

    sv.remove_suffix(3);

    // Create a std::string from the std::string_view
    std::string str{ sv };

    // Get the null-terminated C-style string.
    const char* szNullTerminated{ str.c_str() };

    // Pass the null-terminated string
    // to the function that we want to use.
    std::cout << str << " has "
        << std::strlen(szNullTerminated) << " letter(s)\n";
    // "ball has 4 letter(s)"
}
```

However, **creating a `std::string` every time we want to pass a `std::string_view` as a C-style string is expensive**, so this should be avoided if possible.


## Opening the window (kinda) via the `data()` function

**The string being viewed by a `std::string_view` can be accessed by using the `data()` function, *which returns a C-style string*.** This provides fast access to the string being viewed (as a C-string). **But it should also *only* be used *if the `std::string_view`’s view hasn’t been modified* (e.g. by `remove_prefix` or `remove_suffix`) *and the string being viewed is null-terminated*.**

```c++
#include <cstring>      // For std::strlen
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    std::string_view str{ "balloon" };

    std::cout << str << '\n';

    // We use std::strlen because it's simple.
    // This could be any other function that needs a null-terminated string.
    // It's okay to use data()
    // because we haven't modified the view, and the string is null-terminated.
    std::cout << std::strlen(str.data()) << '\n';       // "7"
}
```

When a `std::string_view` has been modified, `data()` doesn’t always do what we’d like it to. The following example demonstrates what happens when we access `data()` after modifying the view:

```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main() {
    std::string_view str{ "balloon" };

    // Remove the "b"
    str.remove_prefix(1);

    // remove the "oon"
    str.remove_suffix(3);

    // Remember that the above doesn't modify the string,
    // it only changes the region that str is observing.

    std::cout << str << " has "
        << std::strlen(str.data()) << " letter(s)\n";
    // "all has 6 letter(s)"

    std::cout << "str.data() is " << str.data() << '\n';
    // "str.data() is alloon"

    std::cout << "str is " << str << '\n';
    // "str is all"
}
```

Clearly this isn’t what we’d intended, and is a consequence of trying to access the `data()` of a `std::string_view` that has been modified. The length information about the string is lost when we access `data()`. *`std::strlen` and `std::cout` keep reading characters from the underlying string until they find the null-terminator, which is at the end of “balloon”.*

>**Warning**  
Only use `std::string_view::data()` if the `std::string_view`'s view hasn’t been modified and the string being viewed is null-terminated. Using `std::string_view::data()` of a non-null-terminated string can cause undefined behavior.

>>>***The only way to access an internal string of `std::string` is via `.data()` and `.c_str()`***, both of which are guaranteed to return a zero-terminated string.  
`std::string_view` is not zero-terminated, because it's just a view onto another string. It has no influence on the string's data, so the only way to reliably know where the string ends is by storing the string's length. This allows `std::string_view` to shrink the viewed string without modifying it (It simply reduces the length).


## Incomplete implementation

Being a relatively recent feature, `std::string_view` isn’t implemented as well as it could be.

```c++
std::string s{ "hello" };
std::string_view v{ "world" };

// Doesn't work
std::cout << (s + v) << '\n';
std::cout << (v + s) << '\n';

// Potentially unsafe, or not what we want,
// because we're treating the std::string_view as a C-style string.
std::cout << (s + v.data()) << '\n';
std::cout << (v.data() + s) << '\n';

// Ok, but ugly and wasteful
// because we have to construct a new std::string.
std::cout << (s + std::string{ v }) << '\n';
std::cout << (std::string{ v } + s) << '\n';
std::cout << (s + static_cast<std::string>(v)) << '\n';
std::cout << (static_cast<std::string>(v) + s) << '\n';
```

There’s no reason why line 5 and 6 shouldn’t work. They will probably be supported in a future C++ version.
