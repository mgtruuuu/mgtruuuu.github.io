In C++, a **reference** is an alias for an existing object. **Once a reference has been defined, any operation on the reference is applied to the object being referenced.**

>**Key insight**  
A reference is essentially identical to the object being referenced.

**This means we can use a reference to read or modify the object being referenced.** Although references might seem silly, useless, or redundant at first, references are used everywhere in C++ (we’ll see examples of this in a few lessons).

***You can also create references to functions, though this is done less often.***

>>>references to function???

**Modern C++ contains two types of references: lvalue references, and rvalue references.** In this chapter, we’ll discuss lvalue references.

>**Related content**  
Because we’ll be talking about lvalues and rvalues in this lesson, please review [9.2 -- Value categories (lvalues and rvalues)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/value-categories-lvalues-and-rvalues/) if you need a refresher on these terms before proceeding.  
Rvalue references are covered in the chapter on move semantics ([chapter M](https://www.learncpp.com/#ChapterM)).


## Lvalue reference types

An **lvalue reference** (commonly just called a **reference** since prior to `C++11` there was only one type of reference) acts as an alias for an existing lvalue (such as a variable).

To declare an lvalue reference type, we use an ampersand (`&`) in the type declaration:

```c++
int      // a normal int type
int&     // an lvalue reference to an int object
double&  // an lvalue reference to a double object
```


## Lvalue reference variables

One of the things we can do with an lvalue reference type is create an lvalue reference variable. An **lvalue reference variable** is a variable that acts as a reference to an lvalue (usually another variable).

To create an lvalue reference variable, we simply define a variable with an lvalue reference type:

```c++
int main() {

    // x is a normal integer variable.
    int x{ 5 };

    // ref is an lvalue reference variable 
    // that can now be used as an alias for variable x.
    int& ref{ x };

    // Print the value of x. (5)
    std::cout << x << '\n';

    // Print the value of x via ref. (5)
    std::cout << ref << '\n';
}
```

In the above example, the type `int&` defines `ref` as an lvalue reference to an `int`, which we then initialize with lvalue expression `x`. Thereafter, `ref` and `x` can be used synonymously. This program thus prints:

```
5
5
```

From the compiler’s perspective, it doesn’t matter whether the ampersand is “attached” to the type name (i`nt& ref`) or the variable’s name (`int &ref`), and which you choose is a matter of style. Modern C++ programmers tend to prefer attaching the ampersand to the type, as it makes clearer that the reference is part of the type information, not the identifier.

>**Best practice**  
When defining a reference, place the ampersand next to the type (not the reference variable’s name).

>**For advanced readers**  
For those of you already familiar with pointers, the ampersand in this context does not mean “address of”, it means “lvalue reference to”.


## Modifying values through an lvalue reference

In the above example, we showed that we can use a reference to read the value of the object being referenced. We can also use a reference to modify the value of the object being referenced:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // normal integer variable
    int x{ 5 };     

    // ref is now an alias for variable x.
    int& ref{ x }; 

    std::cout << x << ref; // "55"

    // x now has value 6.
    x = 6; 

    std::cout << x << ref; // "66"

    // The object being referenced (x) now has value 7.
    ref = 7; 

    std::cout << x << ref; // "77"
}
```

This code prints:

```
556677
```

In the above example, `ref` is an alias for `x`, so we are able to change the value of `x` through either `x` or `ref`.


## Initialization of lvalue references

**Much like constants, all references must be initialized.**

```c++
int main() {

    // compile error! references must be initialized.
    int& invalidRef;


    int x{ 5 };

    // okay, Reference to int is bound to int variable.
    int& ref{ x };
}
```

When a reference is initialized with an object (or function), we say it is **bound** to that object (or function). The process by which such a reference is bound is called **reference binding**. The object (or function) being referenced is sometimes called the **referent**.

**Lvalue references must be bound to a modifiable lvalue.**

```c++
int main() {
    int x{ 5 };

    // valid, Bound to a modifiable lvalue.
    int& ref{ x }; 

    const int y{ 5 };

    // invalid! Can't be bound to a non-modifiable lvalue.
    int& invalidRef{ y };  

    // invalid! Can't be bound to an r-value.
    int& invalidRef2{ 0 }; 
}
```

**Lvalue references can’t be bound to non-modifiable lvalues or rvalues** (otherwise you’d be able to change those values through the reference, which would be a violation of their const-ness). For this reason, lvalue references are occasionally called **lvalue references to non-const** (sometimes shortened to **non-const reference**).

**In most cases, the type of the reference must match the type of the referent (there are some exceptions to this rule that we’ll discuss when we get into inheritance):**

```c++
int main() {
    int x{ 5 };

    // okay, Reference to int 
    // is bound to int variable.
    int& ref{ x };

    double y{ 6.0 };

    // invalid! Reference to int 
    // can't be bound to double variable.
    int& invalidRef{ y };

    // invalid! Reference to double 
    // can't be bound to int variable.
    double& invalidRef2{ x };
}
```

**Lvalue references to void are disallowed (what would be the point?).**


## References can’t be reseated (changed to refer to another object)

Once initialized, a reference in C++ cannot be **reseated**, meaning it cannot be changed to reference another object.

New C++ programmers often try to reseat a reference by using assignment to provide the reference with another variable to reference. **This will compile and run -- but not function as expected.** Consider the following program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{ 5 };
    int y{ 6 };

    // ref is now an alias for x.
    int& ref{ x };

    // Assigns 6 (the value of y) to x 
    // (the object being referenced by ref).
    ref = y;
    // The above line does NOT change ref 
    // into a reference to variable y!

    // User is expecting this to print 5.
    std::cout << x;
}
```

Perhaps surprisingly, this prints:

```
6
```

**When a reference is evaluated in an expression, it resolves to the object it’s referencing.** So `ref = y` doesn’t change `ref` to now reference `y`. Rather, because `ref` is an alias for `x`, the expression evaluates as if it was written `x = y` -- and since `y` evaluates to value `6`, `x` is assigned the value `6`.


## Lvalue reference scope and duration

**Reference variables follow the same scoping and duration rules that normal variables do:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{ 5 };     // normal integer
    int& ref{ x };  // reference to variable value

}   // x and ref die here.
```


## References and referents have independent lifetimes

**With one exception (that we’ll cover next lesson), the lifetime of a reference and the lifetime of its referent are independent**. In other words, both of the following are true:

- A reference can be destroyed before the object it is referencing.
- The object being referenced can be destroyed before the reference.

**When a reference is destroyed before the referent, the referent is not impacted.** The following program demonstrates this:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x{ 5 };

    {
        int& ref{ x };      // ref is a reference to x
        std::cout << ref;   // prints value of ref (5)

    }   // ref is destroyed here -- x is unaware of this.

    std::cout << x;         // prints value of x (5)

}   // x destroyed here.
```

The above prints:

```
55
```

When `ref` dies, variable `x` carries on as normal, blissfully unaware that a reference to it has been destroyed.


### Dangling references

**When an object being referenced is destroyed before a reference to it, the reference is left referencing an object that no longer exists.** Such a reference is called a **dangling reference**. **Accessing a dangling reference leads to *undefined behavior*.**

Dangling references are fairly easy to avoid, but we’ll show a case where this can happen in practice in [lesson 9.5 -- Pass by lvalue reference](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/pass-by-lvalue-reference/).


## References aren’t objects

Perhaps surprisingly, **references are not objects in C++**. A reference is not required to exist or occupy storage. *If possible, the compiler will optimize references away by replacing all occurrences of a reference with the referent.* **However, this isn’t always possible, and in such cases, references may require storage.**

*This also means that the term “reference variable” is a bit of a misnomer, as variables are objects with a name, and references aren’t objects.*

**Because references aren’t objects, they can’t be used anywhere an object is required** (e.g. you can’t have a reference to a reference, since an lvalue reference must reference an identifiable object). **In cases where you need a reference that is an object or a reference that can be reseated, `std::reference_wrapper` (which we cover in [lesson 16.3 -- Aggregation](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/aggregation/)) provides a solution.**

>**As an aside…**  
Consider the following variables:  
```c++
int  var{};
int& ref1{ var };  // an lvalue reference bound to var
int& ref2{ ref1 }; // an lvalue reference bound to var
```  
Because `ref2` (a reference) is initialized with `ref1` (a reference), you might be tempted to conclude that `ref2` is a reference to a reference. It is not. Because `ref1` is a reference to `var`, when used in an expression (such as an initializer), `ref1` evaluates to `var`. So `ref2` is just a normal lvalue reference (as indicated by its type `int&`), bound to `var`.  
A reference to a reference (to an `int`) would have syntax `int&&` -- but since C++ doesn’t support references to references, this syntax was repurposed in `C++11` to indicate an rvalue reference (which we cover in [lesson M.2 -- R-value references](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/rvalue-references/)).
