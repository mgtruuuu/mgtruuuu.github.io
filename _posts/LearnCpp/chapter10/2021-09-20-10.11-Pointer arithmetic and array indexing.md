# Pointer arithmetic

The C++ language allows you to perform integer addition or subtraction operations on pointers. If `ptr` points to an integer, `ptr + 1` is the address of the next integer in memory after ptr. `ptr - 1` is the address of the previous integer before `ptr`.

**Note that `ptr + 1` does not return the memory address after `ptr`, but the *memory address of the next object of the type* that `ptr` points to.** If ptr points to an integer (assuming 4 bytes), `ptr + 3` means 3 integers (12 bytes) after `ptr`. If `ptr` points to a char, which is always 1 byte, `ptr + 3` means 3 chars (3 bytes) after ptr.

When calculating the result of a pointer arithmetic expression, the compiler always multiplies the integer operand by the size of the object being pointed to. This is called **scaling**.


## Arrays are laid out sequentially in memory


# Pointer arithmetic, arrays, and the magic behind indexing


# Using a pointer to iterate through an array

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::begin and std::end

bool isVowel(char ch) {
    switch (ch) {
    case 'A':
    case 'a':
    case 'E':
    case 'e':
    case 'I':
    case 'i':
    case 'O':
    case 'o':
    case 'U':
    case 'u':
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

int main() {
    char name[]{ "Mollie" };

    // walk through all the elements of name and count how many calls to isVowel return true
    auto numVowels{ std::count_if(std::begin(name), std::end(name), isVowel) };

    std::cout << name << " has " << numVowels << " vowels.\n";
}
```

`std::begin` returns an iterator (pointer) to the first element, while `std::end` returns an iterator to the element that would be one after the last. The iterator returned by `std::end` is only used as a marker, accessing it causes undefined behavior, because it doesn’t point to a real element.

`std::begin` and `std::end` only work on arrays with a known size. If the array decayed to a pointer, we can calculate begin and end manually.

```c++
// nameLength is the number of elements in the array.
std::count_if(name, name + nameLength, isVowel)

// Don't do this. Accessing invalid indexes causes undefined behavior.
// std::count_if(name, &name[nameLength], isVowel)
```

# Quiz time

## Question #1

- **Q.** Why does the following code work?

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int arr[]{ 1, 2, 3 };

	std::cout << 2[arr] << '\n';
}
```

- **A.** The subscript operator (`[]`) is identical to an addition and an indirection, the operands can be swapped.  

It’s an interesting observation, but don’t use this syntax in real code. **This only works for the built-in subscript operator.** You’ll learn about types with custom operators where this doesn’t work later.

## Question #2

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

int* find(int* begin, int* end, int value) {
    // We're using !=, rather than <, because != is compatible with more types
    // than <. This is common practice around iterators, which are covered later.
    // It has no advantage when used with pointers, but makes code consistent.
    for (int* p{ begin }; p != end; ++p) {
        if (*p == value) {
            return p;
        }
    }

    return end;
}

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 20, 16, 40 };

    int* found{ find(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), 20) };

    if (found != std::end(arr)) {
        std::cout << *found << '\n';
    }
}
```

>**Tip**  
`find()` is a standard function:

```c++
#include <algorithm> // std::find
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 20, 16, 40 };

    // Note: std::find returns an iterator, we'll talk about iterators later.
    auto found{ std::find(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), 20) };

    if (found != std::end(arr)) {
        std::cout << *found << '\n';
    }
}
```
