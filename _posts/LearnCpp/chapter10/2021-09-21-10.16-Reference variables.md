So far, we’ve discussed two different kinds of variables:

- Normal variables, which hold values directly.

- Pointers, which hold the address of another value (or null) and their value can be retrieved through indirection of address they point to.

References are the third basic kind of variable that C++ supports. A **reference** is a C++ variable that acts as an alias to another object or value.

C++ supports three kinds of references:

- **References to non-const values** (typically just called “**references**”, or “**non-const references**”), which we’ll discuss in this lesson.
- **References to const values** (often called “**const references**”), which we’ll discuss in the next lesson.
- C++11 added **r-value references**, which we cover in detail in the chapter on move semantics.


## References to non-const values

```c++
int value{ 5 };     // normal integer
int &ref{ value };  // reference to variable value
```

```c++
int value{ 5 };

// These two do the same.
int& ref1{ value };
int &ref2{ value };
```

>**Best practice**  
When declaring a reference variable, put the ampersand next to the type to make it easier to distinguish it from the address-of operator.


## References as aliases

References generally act identically to the values they’re referencing. In this sense, a reference acts as an alias for the object being referenced. For example:

```c++
int x{ 5 };     // normal integer
int& y{ x };    // y is a reference to x
int& z{ y };    // z is also a reference to x
```

In the above snippet, setting or getting the value of x, y, or z will all do the same thing (set or get the value of x).


## l-values and r-values

In C++, variables are a type of l-value (pronounced ell-value). An **l-value** is a value that has an address (in memory). Since all variables have addresses, all variables are l-values. The name l-value came about because l-values are the only values that can be on the left side of an assignment statement. When we do an assignment, the left hand side of the assignment operator must be an l-value. Consequently, a statement like `5 = 6`; will cause a compile error, because 5 is not an l-value. The value of 5 has no memory, and thus nothing can be assigned to it. 5 means 5, and its value can not be reassigned. When an l-value has a value assigned to it, the current value at that memory address is overwritten.

The opposite of l-values are r-values (pronounced arr-values). An **r-value** is an expression that is not an l-value. Examples of r-values are literals (such as 5, which evaluates to 5) and non-l-value expressions (such as 2 + x).

Here is an example of some assignment statements, showing how the r-values evaluate:

```c++
int y;      // define y as an integer variable
y = 4;      // 4 evaluates to 4, which is then assigned to y
y = 2 + 5;  // 2 + 5 evaluates to 7, which is then assigned to y

int x;      // define x as an integer variable
x = y;      // y evaluates to 7 (from before), which is then assigned to x.
x = x;      // x evaluates to 7, which is then assigned to x (useless!)
x = x + 1;  // x + 1 evaluates to 8, which is then assigned to x.
```

The key takeaway is that on the left side of the assignment, you must have something that represents a memory address (such as a variable). Everything on the right side of the assignment will be evaluated to produce a value.

**Note: const variables are considered non-modifiable l-values.**


## References must be initialized 

References must be initialized when created:

```c++
int value{ 5 };
int& ref{ value };  // valid reference, initialized to variable value

int& invalidRef;    // invalid, needs to reference something
```

Unlike pointers, which can hold a null value, there is no such thing as a null reference.

**References to non-const values can only be initialized with non-const l-values.** They can not be initialized with const l-values or r-values.

```c++
int x{ 5 };
int& ref1{ x }; // okay, x is an non-const l-value

const int y{ 7 };
int& ref2{ y }; // not okay, y is a const l-value

int& ref3{ 6 }; // not okay, 6 is an r-value
```

Note that in the middle case, you can’t initialize a non-const reference with a const object -- otherwise you’d be able to change the value of the const object through the reference, which would violate the const-ness of the object.


## References can not be reassigned

Once initialized, a reference can not be changed to reference another variable. Consider the following snippet:

```c++
int value1{ 5 };
int value2{ 6 };

int& ref{ value1 }; // okay, ref is now an alias for value1

// assigns 6 (the value of value2) to value1 -- does NOT change the reference!
ref = value2;       
```


## References as function parameters

References are most often used as function parameters. In this context, the reference parameter acts as an alias for the argument, and no copy of the argument is made into the parameter. This can lead to better performance if the argument is large or expensive to copy.

```c++
#include <iostream>

// ref is a reference to the argument passed in, not a copy
void changeN(int& ref) {
	ref = 6;
}

int main() {
	int n{ 5 };

	std::cout << n << '\n';
    // "5"

    // note that this argument does not need to be a reference
	changeN(n); 

	std::cout << n << '\n';}
    // "6"
```


>**Best practice**  
Pass arguments by non-const reference (rather than by pointer) when the argument needs to be modified by the function.

The primary downside of using non-const references as function parameters is that the argument *must* be a non-const l-value. This can be restrictive. We’ll talk more about this (and how to get around it) in the next lesson.


## Using references to pass C-style arrays to functions

One of the most annoying issues with C-style arrays is that in most cases they decay to pointers when evaluated. However, if a C-style array is passed by reference, this decaying does not happen.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

// Note: You need to specify the array size in the function declaration
void printElements(int (&arr)[4]) {
    // we can now do this since the array won't decay
    int length{ static_cast<int>(std::size(arr)) }; 

    for (int i{ 0 }; i < length; ++i)
        std::cout << arr[i] << '\n';
}

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 99, 20, 14, 80 };

    printElements(arr);
}
```


## References as shortcuts

A secondary (much less used) use of references is to provide easier access to nested data. Consider the following struct:

```c++
struct Something {
    int value1;
    float value2;
};

struct Other {
    Something something;
    int otherValue;
};

Other other;
```

```c++
int& ref{ other.something.value1 };
// ref can now be used in place of other.something.value1
```

The following two statements are thus identical:

```c++
other.something.value1 = 5;
ref = 5;
```

## References vs pointers

References and pointers have an interesting relationship -- a reference acts like a pointer that implicitly performs indirection through it when accessed (references are usually implemented internally by the compiler using pointers). Thus given the following:

```c++
int value{ 5 };
int* const ptr{ &value };
int& ref{ value };
```

*ptr and ref evaluate identically. As a result, the following two statements produce the same effect:

```c++
*ptr = 5;
ref = 5;
```

Because references must be initialized to valid objects (cannot be null) and can not be changed once set, references are generally much safer to use than pointers (since there’s no risk of indirection through a null pointer). However, they are also a bit more limited in functionality accordingly.

If a given task can be solved with either a reference or a pointer, the reference should generally be preferred. Pointers should only be used in situations where references are not sufficient (such as dynamically allocating memory).


## Summary

References allow us to define aliases to other objects or values. References to non-const values can only be initialized with non-const l-values. References can not be reassigned once initialized.

References are most often used as function parameters when we either want to modify the value of the argument, or when we want to avoid making an expensive copy of the argument.
