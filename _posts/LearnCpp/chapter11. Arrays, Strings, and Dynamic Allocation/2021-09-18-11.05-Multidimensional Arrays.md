**The elements of an array can be of any data type, including arrays!** An array of arrays is called a **multidimensional array**.

```c++
// a 3-element array of 5-element arrays
int array[3][5]; 
```

Since we have 2 subscripts, this is a two-dimensional array.

In a two-dimensional array, it is convenient to think of the first (left) subscript as being the row, and the second (right) subscript as being the column. This is called **row-major order**. Conceptually, the above two-dimensional array is laid out as follows:

```
[0][0]  [0][1]  [0][2]  [0][3]  [0][4]      // row 0
[1][0]  [1][1]  [1][2]  [1][3]  [1][4]      // row 1
[2][0]  [2][1]  [2][2]  [2][3]  [2][4]      // row 2
```

To access the elements of a two-dimensional array, simply use two subscripts:

```c++
array[2][3] = 7;
```


## Initializing two-dimensional arrays

**To initialize a two-dimensional array, it is easiest to use nested braces, with each set of numbers representing a row:**

```c++
int array[3][5]{
    { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },      // row 0
    { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 },     // row 1
    { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 }  // row 2
};
```

*Although some compilers will let you omit the inner braces, we highly recommend you include them anyway, both for readability purposes and because of the way that C++ will replace missing initializers with 0.*

```c++
int array[3][5]{
    { 1, 2 },           // row 0 = 1, 2, 0, 0, 0
    { 6, 7, 8 },        // row 1 = 6, 7, 8, 0, 0
    { 11, 12, 13, 14 }  // row 2 = 11, 12, 13, 14, 0
};
```

**Two-dimensional arrays with initializer lists can omit (only) the *leftmost* length specification:**

```c++
int array[][5]{
    { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 },
    { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 },
    { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 }
};
```

The compiler can do the math to figure out what the array length is. **However, the following is not allowed:**

```c++
// compile error!
int array[][]{
    { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
    { 5, 6, 7, 8 }
};
```

**Just like normal arrays, multidimensional arrays can still be initialized to 0 as follows:**

```c++
int array[3][5]{};
```


## Accessing elements in a two-dimensional array

**Accessing all of the elements of a two-dimensional array requires two loops:** one for the row, and one for the column. Since two-dimensional arrays are typically accessed row by row, the row index is typically used as the outer loop.

```c++
// Step through the rows in the array.
for (int row{ 0 }; row < numRows; ++row)
    // Step through each element in the row.
    for (int col{ 0 }; col < numCols; ++col)
        std::cout << array[row][col];
```

**In C++11, for-each loops can also be used with multidimensional arrays.** We’ll cover for-each loops in detail later.

>>> ???  
```c++
int Array2D[3][4]{0,};
//
for (auto& rows : Array2D) {
    for (auto elem : rows)  std::cout << elem << ' ';
    //
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```


## Multidimensional arrays larger than two dimensions

Multidimensional arrays may be larger than two dimensions. Here is a declaration of a three-dimensional array:

```c++
int array[5][4][3];
```

*Three-dimensional arrays are hard to initialize in any kind of intuitive way using initializer lists, so it’s typically better to initialize the array to 0 and explicitly assign values using nested loops.*

Accessing the element of a three-dimensional array is analogous to the two-dimensional case:

```c++
std::cout << array[3][1][2];
```


## A two-dimensional array example

Let’s take a look at a practical example of a two-dimensional array:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    constexpr int numRows{ 10 };
    constexpr int numCols{ 10 };

    // Declare a 10x10 array.
    int product[numRows][numCols]{};

    // Calculate a multiplication table.
    for (int row{ 1 }; row < numRows; ++row)
        for (int col{ 1 }; col < numCols; ++col)
            product[row][col] = row * col;

    // Print the table.
    for (int row{ 1 }; row < numRows; ++row) {
        for (int col{ 1 }; col < numCols; ++col)
            std::cout << product[row][col] << '\t';

        std::cout << '\n';
    }
}
```

This program calculates and prints a multiplication table for all values between 1 and 9 (inclusive). Note that when printing the table, the for loops start from 1 instead of 0. This is to omit printing the 0 column and 0 row, which would just be a bunch of 0s! Here is the output:

```
1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
2    4    6    8    10   12   14   16   18
3    6    9    12   15   18   21   24   27
4    8    12   16   20   24   28   32   36
5    10   15   20   25   30   35   40   45
6    12   18   24   30   36   42   48   54
7    14   21   28   35   42   49   56   63
8    16   24   32   40   48   56   64   72
9    18   27   36   45   54   63   72   81
```

Two dimensional arrays are commonly used in tile-based games, where each array element represents one tile. They’re also used in 3d computer graphics (as matrices) in order to rotate, scale, and reflect shapes.
