In this lesson, we’ll take a look at how to construct objects of std::string, as well as how to create strings from numbers and vice-versa.

String construction

The string classes have a number of constructors that can be used to create strings. We’ll take a look at each of them here.

Note: string::size_type resolves to size_t, which is the same unsigned integral type that is returned by the sizeof operator. Its actual size varies depending on environment. For purposes of this tutorial, envision it as an unsigned int.


### string::string()

- This is the default constructor. It creates an empty string.

Sample code:

```c++
std::string sSource;
std::cout << sSource;
```

Output:

```

```
