Each block defines its own scope region. So what happens when we have a variable inside a nested block that has the same name as a variable in an outer block? When this happens, the nested variable “hides” the outer variable in areas where they are both in scope. This is called **name hiding** or **shadowing**.


## Shadowing of local variables

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {            // outer block

    // Here's the outer block apples.
    int apples{ 5 };

    {                   // nested block

        // apples refers to outer block apples here.
        // Print value of outer block apples.
        std::cout << apples << '\n';


        // Define apples in the scope of the nested block.
        int apples{ 0 };

        // apples now refers to the nested block apples.
        // The outer block apples is temporarily hidden.

        // This assigns value 10 to nested block apples, 
        // not outer block apples.
        apples = 10;

        // Print value of nested block apples.
        std::cout << apples << '\n';

    }                   // Nested block apples destroyed.

    // Prints value of outer block apples.
    std::cout << apples << '\n';

}                       // Outer block apples destroyed.
```

Note that if the nested block apples had not been defined, the name `apples` in the nested block would still refer to the outer block `apples`, **so the assignment of value 10 to `apples` would have applied to the outer block `apples`**:

**When inside the nested block, there’s no way to directly access the shadowed variable from the outer block.**


## Shadowing of global variables

**Similar to how variables in a nested block can shadow variables in an outer block, local variables with the same name as a global variable will shadow the global variable wherever the local variable is in scope:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int value{ 5 };     // global variable

void foo() {

    // value is not shadowed here, 
    // so this refers to the global value.
    std::cout << "global variable value: " << value << '\n';
}

int main() {

    // Hides the global variable value until the end of this block.
    int value{ 7 };

    // Increments local value, not global value.
    ++value;

    std::cout << "local variable value: " << value << '\n';
    // "local variable value : 8"

    foo();
    // "global variable value : 5"

}   // Local value is destroyed.
```

However, because global variables are part of the global namespace, **we can use the scope operator (`::`) with no prefix to tell the compiler we mean the global variable** instead of the local variable.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int value{ 5 };         // global variable

int main() {

    // Hides the global variable value.
    int value{ 7 };

    // Increments local value, not global value.
    ++value;

    // Decrements global value, not local value 
    // (parenthesis added for readability)
    --(::value);

    std::cout << "local variable value: " << value << '\n';
    std::cout << "global variable value: " << ::value << '\n';

}   // Local value is destroyed.
```


## Avoid variable shadowing

**Shadowing of local variables should generally be avoided, as it can lead to inadvertent errors where the wrong variable is used or modified.** *Some compilers will issue a warning when a variable is shadowed.*

For the same reason that we recommend avoiding shadowing local variables, **we recommend avoiding shadowing global variables as well**. This is trivially avoidable if all of your global names use a “g_” prefix.

>**Best practice**  
Avoid variable shadowing.
