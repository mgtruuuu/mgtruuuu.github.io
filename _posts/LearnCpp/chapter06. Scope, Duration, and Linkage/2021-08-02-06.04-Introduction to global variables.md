In C++, variables can also be declared outside of a function. Such variables are called **global variables**.


## Declaring and naming global variables

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Variables declared outside of a function 
// are global variables.
int g_x{};

void doSomething() {

    // Global variables can be seen and used everywhere in the file.
    g_x = 3;
    std::cout << g_x << '\n';
}

int main() {
    doSomething();
    // "3\n"

    std::cout << g_x << '\n';
    // "3\n"

    // Global variables can be seen and used everywhere in the file.
    g_x = 5;
    std::cout << g_x << '\n';
    // "5\n"

}   // g_x goes out of scope here.
```

**By convention, many developers prefix global variable identifiers with “g” or “g_” to indicate that they are global.**


>**Best practice**  
Consider using a “g” or “g_” prefix for global variables to help differentiate them from local variables.


## Global variables have file scope and static duration

Global variables have **file scope** (also informally called **global scope** or **global namespace scope**), which means they are visible from the point of declaration until the end of the file in which they are declared. Once declared, a global variable can be used anywhere in the file from that point onward! In the above example, global variable `g_x` is used in both functions `doSomething()` and `main()`.

*Because they are defined outside of a function, global variables are considered to be part of the global namespace (hence the term “global namespace scope”).*

Global variables are *created when the program starts, and destroyed when it ends*. This is called **static duration**. Variables with static duration are sometimes called **static variables**.

**Unlike local variables, which are uninitialized by default, static variables are zero-initialized by default.**


## Global variable initialization

Non-constant global variables can be optionally initialized:

```c++
int g_x;        // no explicit initializer 
                // (zero-initialized by default)
int g_y{};      // zero initialized
int g_z{ 1 };   // initialized with value
```


## Constant global variables

**Just like local variables, global variables can be constant.** As with all constants, constant global variables must be initialized.

We discuss global constants in more detail in [lesson 6.9 -- Sharing global constants across multiple files (using inline variables)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/sharing-global-constants-across-multiple-files-using-inline-variables/).


## A word of caution about (non-constant) global variables

New programmers are often tempted to use lots of global variables, because they can be used without having to explicitly pass them to every function that needs them. However, use of non-constant global variables should generally be avoided altogether! We’ll discuss why in upcoming [lesson 6.8 -- Why (non-const) global variables are evil](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/why-non-const-global-variables-are-evil/).


## Quick Summary

```c++
// Non-constant global variables
int g_x;                // Defines non-initialized global variable
                        // (zero initialized by default).
int g_x{};              // Defines explicitly zero-initialized global variable.
int g_x{ 1 };           // Defines explicitly initialized global variable.

// Const global variables
const int g_y;          // compile error! Const variables must be initialized.
const int g_y{ 2 };     // Defines initialized global constant.

// Constexpr global variables
constexpr int g_y;      // compile error! Constexpr variables must be initialized.
constexpr int g_y{ 3 }; // Defines initialized global const.
```
