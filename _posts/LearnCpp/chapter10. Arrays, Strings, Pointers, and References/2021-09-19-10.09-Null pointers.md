## Null values and null pointers

Just like normal variables, pointers are not initialized when they are instantiated. Unless a value is assigned, a pointer will point to some garbage address by default.

Besides memory addresses, there is one additional value that a pointer can hold: a null value. A **null value** is a special value that means the pointer is not pointing at anything. A pointer holding a null value is called a **null pointer**.

```c++
// Assign a pointer a null value
// by initializing or assigning it the literal 0

float* ptr { 0 };  // ptr is now a null pointer

float* ptr2; // ptr2 is uninitialized
ptr2 = 0; // ptr2 is now a null pointer
```

```c++
double* ptr { 0 };

// pointers convert to boolean false if they are null,
// and boolean true if they are non-null
if (ptr)
    std::cout << "ptr is pointing to a double value.";
else
    std::cout << "ptr is a null pointer.";
```

>**Best practice**  
Initialize your pointers to a null value if you’re not giving them another value.


## Indirection through null pointers

In the previous lesson, we noted that indirection through a garbage pointer would lead to undefined results. **Indirection through a null pointer also results in undefined behavior.** In most cases, it will crash your application.


## The NULL macro

```c++
#include <cstddef> // for NULL

double* ptr { NULL }; // ptr is a null pointer
```

The value of `NULL` is **implementation defined**, but is usually defined as the integer constant 0. Note: as of C++11, NULL can be defined as `nullptr` instead (which we’ll discuss in a bit).

>**Best practice**  
Because `NULL` is a preprocessor macro with an implementation defined value, avoid using `NULL`.


## The perils of using 0 (or NULL) for null pointers

Note that the value of 0 isn’t a pointer type, so assigning 0 (or `NULL`, pre-C++11) to a pointer to denote that the pointer is a null pointer is a little inconsistent. In rare cases, when used as a literal argument, it can even cause problems because the compiler can’t tell whether we mean a null pointer or the integer 0:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstddef> // for NULL

void print(int x) {
	std::cout << "print(int): " << x << '\n';
}

void print(int* x) {
	if (!x)
		std::cout << "print(int*): null\n";
	else
		std::cout << "print(int*): " << *x << '\n';
}

int main() {
	int* x { NULL };
	print(x);   // calls print(int*) because x has type int*
	print(0);   // calls print(int) because 0 is an integer literal
	print(NULL);// likely calls print(int), although we probably wanted print(int*)
}
```


## `nullptr` in C++11

```c++
// note: ptr is still an integer pointer, just set to a null value
int* ptr { nullptr }; 
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

void print(int x) {
	std::cout << "print(int): " << x << '\n';
}

void print(int* x) {
	if (!x)
		std::cout << "print(int*): null\n";
	else
		std::cout << "print(int*): " << *x << '\n';
}

int main() {
	int* x { nullptr };
	print(x);       // calls print(int*)

	print(nullptr); // calls print(int*) as desired
}
```

>**Best practice**  
Use `nullptr` to initialize your pointers to a null value.


## std::nullptr_t

C++11 also introduces a new type called `std::nullptr_t` (in header <cstddef>). `std::nullptr_t` can only hold one value: `nullptr`! While this may seem kind of silly, it’s useful in one situation. If we want to write a function that accepts only a `nullptr` argument, what type do we make the parameter? The answer is `std::nullptr_t`.


```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstddef> // for std::nullptr_t

void doSomething(std::nullptr_t ptr) {
    std::cout << "in doSomething()\n";
}

int main() {
    // call doSomething with an argument of type std::nullptr_t
    doSomething(nullptr); 
}
```
