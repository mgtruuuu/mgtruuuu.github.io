# Pointer arithmetic

The C++ language allows you to perform integer addition or subtraction operations on pointers. If `ptr` points to an integer, `ptr + 1` is the address of the next integer in memory after ptr. `ptr - 1` is the address of the previous integer before `ptr`.

Note that `ptr + 1` does not return the memory address after `ptr`, **but the *memory address of the next object of the type* that `ptr` points to**. If `ptr` points to an integer (assuming 4 bytes), `ptr + 3` means 3 integers (12 bytes) after `ptr`. If `ptr` points to a char, which is always 1 byte, `ptr + 3` means 3 chars (3 bytes) after `ptr`.

When calculating the result of a pointer arithmetic expression, the compiler always multiplies the integer operand by the size of the object being pointed to. This is called **scaling**.

Consider the following program:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value{ 7 };
    int* ptr{ &value };

    std::cout << ptr << '\n';   // "0012FF7C"
    std::cout << ptr+1 << '\n'; // "0012FF80"
    std::cout << ptr+2 << '\n'; // "0012FF84"
    std::cout << ptr+3 << '\n'; // "0012FF88"
}
```

As you can see, each of these addresses differs by 4 (7C + 4 = 80 in hexadecimal). This is because an integer is 4 bytes on the author’s machine.

The same program using `short` instead of `int`:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    short value{ 7 };
    short* ptr{ &value };

    std::cout << ptr << '\n';
    std::cout << ptr+1 << '\n';
    std::cout << ptr+2 << '\n';
    std::cout << ptr+3 << '\n';
}
```

Because a `short` is 2 bytes, each address differs by 2.


## Arrays are laid out sequentially in memory

By using the address-of operator (`&`), we can determine that arrays are laid out sequentially in memory. That is, elements 0, 1, 2, … are all adjacent to each other, in order.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int array[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

    std::cout << "Element 0 is at address: " << &array[0] << '\n';
    std::cout << "Element 1 is at address: " << &array[1] << '\n';
    std::cout << "Element 2 is at address: " << &array[2] << '\n';
    std::cout << "Element 3 is at address: " << &array[3] << '\n';
}
```


# Pointer arithmetic, arrays, and the magic behind indexing

In the section above, you learned that arrays are laid out in memory sequentially.

In the previous lesson, you learned that a fixed array can decay into a pointer that points to the first element (element 0) of the array.

Also in a section above, you learned that adding 1 to a pointer returns the memory address of the next object of that type in memory.

Therefore, we might conclude that adding 1 to an array should point to the second element (element 1) of the array. We can verify experimentally that this is true:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
     int array[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

     std::cout << &array[1] << '\n';    // print memory address of array element 1
     std::cout << array+1 << '\n';      // print memory address of array pointer + 1

     std::cout << array[1] << '\n';     // prints 7
     std::cout << *(array+1) << '\n';   // prints 7 (note the parenthesis required here)
}
```

It turns out that when the compiler sees the subscript operator (`[]`), **it actually translates that into a pointer addition and indirection**! Generalizing, `array[n]` is the same as `*(array + n)`, where `n` is an integer. The subscript operator `[]` is there both to look nice and for ease of use (so you don’t have to remember the parenthesis).


# Using a pointer to iterate through an array

We can use a pointer and pointer arithmetic to loop through an array. Although not commonly done this way (using subscripts is generally easier to read and less error prone), the following example goes to show it is possible:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::begin and std::end

bool isVowel(char ch) {
    switch (ch) {
    case 'A':
    case 'a':
    case 'E':
    case 'e':
    case 'I':
    case 'i':
    case 'O':
    case 'o':
    case 'U':
    case 'u':
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

int main() {
    char name[]{ "Mollie" };
    int arrayLength{ static_cast<int>(std::size(name)) };
    int numVowels{ 0 };

    for (char* ptr{ name }; ptr != (name + arrayLength); ++ptr)
        if (isVowel(*ptr))
            ++numVowels;

    std::cout << name << " has " << numVowels << " vowels.\n";
    // "Mollie has 3 vowels"
}
```

How does it work? This program uses a pointer to step through each of the elements in an array. Remember that arrays decay to pointers to the first element of the array. So by assigning ptr to name, ptr will also point to the first element of the array. Indirection through ptr is performed for each element when we call `isVowel(*ptr)`, and if the element is a vowel, numVowels is incremented. Then the for loop uses the ++ operator to advance the pointer to the next character in the array. The for loop terminates when all characters have been examined.

Because counting elements is common, the algorithms library offers `std::count_if`, which counts elements that fulfill a condition. We can replace the for-loop with a call to `std::count_if`.

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // for std::begin and std::end

bool isVowel(char ch) {
    switch (ch) {
    case 'A':
    case 'a':
    case 'E':
    case 'e':
    case 'I':
    case 'i':
    case 'O':
    case 'o':
    case 'U':
    case 'u':
        return true;
    default:
        return false;
    }
}

int main() {
    char name[]{ "Mollie" };

    // walk through all the elements of name
    // and count how many calls to isVowel return true
    auto numVowels{ std::count_if(std::begin(name), std::end(name), isVowel) };

    std::cout << name << " has " << numVowels << " vowels.\n";
    // "Mollie has 3 vowels"
}
```

`std::begin` returns an iterator (pointer) to the first element, while `std::end` returns an iterator to the element that would be one after the last. The iterator returned by `std::end` is *only* used as a marker, accessing it causes undefined behavior, because it doesn’t point to a real element.

**`std::begin` and `std::end` only work on arrays with a known size.** If the array decayed to a pointer, we can calculate begin and end manually.

```c++
// nameLength is the number of elements in the array.
std::count_if(name, name + nameLength, isVowel)

// Don't do this. Accessing invalid indexes causes undefined behavior.
// std::count_if(name, &name[nameLength], isVowel)
```

Note that we’re calculating `name + nameLength`, not `name + nameLength - 1`, because we don’t want the last element, but the pseudo-element one past the last.

Calculating begin and end of an array like this works for all algorithms that need a begin and end argument.


# Quiz time

## Question #1

- **Q.** Why does the following code work?

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 1, 2, 3 };

    std::cout << 2[arr] << '\n';
}
```

- **A.** The subscript operator (`[]`) is identical to an addition and an indirection, the operands can be swapped.  

It’s an interesting observation, but don’t use this syntax in real code. **This only works for the built-in subscript operator.** You’ll learn about types with custom operators where this doesn’t work later.

## Question #2

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

int* find(int* begin, int* end, int value) {
    // We're using !=, rather than <, because != is compatible with more types
    // than <. This is common practice around iterators, which are covered later.
    // It has no advantage when used with pointers, but makes code consistent.
    for (int* p{ begin }; p != end; ++p)
        if (*p == value)
            return p;

    return end;
}

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 20, 16, 40 };

    int* found{ find(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), 20) };

    if (found != std::end(arr))
        std::cout << *found << '\n';
}
```

>**Tip**  
`find()` is a standard function:

```c++
#include <algorithm> // std::find
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

int main() {
    int arr[]{ 2, 5, 4, 10, 8, 20, 16, 40 };

    // Note: std::find returns an iterator, we'll talk about iterators later.
    auto found{ std::find(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), 20) };

    if (found != std::end(arr))
        std::cout << *found << '\n';
}
```
