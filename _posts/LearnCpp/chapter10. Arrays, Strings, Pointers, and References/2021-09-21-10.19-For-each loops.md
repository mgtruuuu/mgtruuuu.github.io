In [lesson 10.3 -- Arrays and loops](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/arrays-and-loops/), we showed examples where we used a *for loop* to iterate through each element of an array.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // std::size

int main() {
    constexpr int scores[]{ 84, 92, 76, 81, 56 };
    constexpr int numStudents{ std::size(scores) };

    // Keep track of our largest score.
    int maxScore{ 0 }; 

    for (int student{ 0 }; student < numStudents; ++student)
        if (scores[student] > maxScore)
            maxScore = scores[student];

    std::cout << "The best score was " << maxScore << '\n';
}
```

While *for loops* provide a convenient and flexible way to iterate through an array, they are also easy to mess up and prone to off-by-one errors.

There’s a simpler and safer type of loop called a **for-each loop** (also called a **range-based for-loop**) for cases where we want to iterate through every element in an array (or other list-type structure).


## For-each loops

The for-each statement has a syntax that looks like this:

```c++
for (element_declaration : array)  
    __statement;
```

**When this statement is encountered, the loop will iterate through each element in array, assigning the value of the current array element to the variable declared in `element_declaration`.** For best results, *`element_declaration` should have the same type as the array elements*, otherwise type conversion will occur.

Let’s take a look at a simple example that uses a for-each loop to print all of the elements in an array named `fibonacci`:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    constexpr int fibonacci[]{
        0, 1, 1, 2,
        3, 5, 8, 13,
        21, 34, 55, 89
    };

    // Iterate over array fibonacci.
    for (int number : fibonacci)
        // We access the array element 
        // for this iteration through variable number.
        std::cout << number << ' ';
}
```

Let’s take a closer look at how this works. First, the for loop executes, and variable `number` is set to the value of the first element, which has value `0`. The program executes the statement, which prints `0`. Then the for loop executes again, and `number` is set to the value of the second element, which has value `1`. The statement executes again, which prints `1`. The for loop continues to iterate through each of the `number`s in turn, executing the statement for each one, until there are no elements left in the array to iterate over. At that point, the loop terminates, and the program continues execution (returning `0` to the operating system).

Note that **variable `number` is *not* an array index**. It’s assigned the value of the array element for the current loop iteration.


## For each loops and the `auto` keyword

Because `element_declaration` should have the same type as the array elements, this is an ideal case in which to use the `auto` keyword, and let C++ deduce the type of the array elements for us.

Here’s the above example, using `auto`:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    constexpr int fibonacci[]{
        0, 1, 1, 2,
        3, 5, 8, 13,
        21, 34, 55, 89
    };

    // Type is auto, so number has its type
    // deduced from the fibonacci array.
    for (auto number : fibonacci)
        std::cout << number << ' ';
}
```


## For-each loops and references

In the following for-each example, our element declarations are declared by value:

```c++
std::string array[]{
    "peter", "likes", "frozen", "yogurt"
};

// element will be a copy
// of the current array element.
for (auto element : array)
    std::cout << element << ' ';
```

**This means each array element iterated over will be copied into variable element.** Copying array elements can be expensive, and most of the time we really just want to refer to the original element. Fortunately, we can use references for this:

```c++
std::string array[]{
    "peter", "likes", "frozen", "yogurt"
};

// The ampersand makes element
// a reference to the actual array element,
// preventing a copy from being made.
for (auto& element: array) 
    std::cout << element << ' ';
```

In the above example, `element` will be a reference to the currently iterated array element, avoiding having to make a copy. Also any changes to `element` will affect the array being iterated over, something not possible if `element` is a normal variable.

And, of course, it’s a good idea to make your reference `const` if you’re intending to use it in a read-only fashion:

```c++
std::string array[]{
    "peter", "likes", "frozen", "yogurt"
};

// element is a const reference
// to the currently iterated array element.
for (const auto& element: array) 
    std::cout << element << ' ';
```

>**Best practice**  
In for-each loops element declarations, if your elements are non-fundamental types, use references or const references for performance reasons.s


## Rewriting the max scores example using a for-each loop

Here’s the example at the top of the lesson rewritten using a for each loop:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    constexpr int scores[]{
        84, 92, 76, 81, 56
    };
    int maxScore{ 0 };

    // Iterate over array scores,
    // assigning each value in turn to variable score.
    for (auto score : scores) 
        if (score > maxScore)
            maxScore = score;

    std::cout << "The best score was "
        << maxScore << '\n';
}
```

Note that in this example, **we no longer have to manually subscript the array or get its size**. We can access the array element directly through variable `score`. **The array has to have *size information*.** *An array that decayed to a pointer cannot be used in a for-each loop.*


## For-each loops and non-arrays

*For-each loops* don’t only work with fixed arrays, **they work with many kinds of list-like structures**, such as vectors (e.g. `std::vector`), linked lists, trees, and maps. We haven’t covered any of these yet, so don’t worry if you don’t know what these are. Just remember that *for each loops* provide a flexible and generic way to iterate through more than just arrays.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Note use of std::vector here
    // rather than a fixed array.
    std::vector fibonacci{
        0, 1, 1, 2,
        3, 5, 8, 13,
        21, 34, 55, 89
    };
    // (Before C++17)
    /*
    std::vector<int> fibonacci{
        0, 1, 1, 2,
        3, 5, 8, 13,
        21, 34, 55, 89
    };
    */

    for (auto number : fibonacci)
        std::cout << number << ' ';
}
```


## For-each doesn’t work with pointers to an array

In order to iterate through the array, for-each needs to know how big the array is, which means knowing the array size. **Because arrays that have decayed into a pointer *do not know their size*, for-each loops will not work with them!**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int sumArray(const int array[]) {
// array is a pointer.

    int sum{ 0 };

    // compile error! the size of array isn't known.
    for (auto number : array)
        sum += number;

    return sum;
}

int main() {
    constexpr int array[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 };

    // array decays into a pointer here.
    std::cout << sumArray(array) << '\n';
}
```

**Similarly, dynamic arrays won’t work with for-each loops for the same reason.**


## Can I get the index of the current element?

**`For-each loops` do not provide a direct way to get the array index of the current element.** *This is because many of the structures that for-each loops can be used with (such as linked lists) are not directly indexable!*

**Since C++20, range-based for-loops can be used with an `init-statement` just like the `init-statement` in if-statements.** We can use the `init-statement` to create a manual index counter without polluting the function in which the for-loop is placed.

The `init-statement` is placed right before the loop variable:

```c++
for (init-statement; element_declaration : array)  
    __statement;
```

In the following code, we have two arrays which are correlated by index. For example, the student with the name at `names[3]` has a score of `scores[3]`. Whenever a student with a new high score is found, we print their name and difference in points to the previous high score.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Names of the students.
    std::string names[]{
        "Alex", "Betty", "Caroline", "Dave", "Emily"
    };
    constexpr int scores[]{ 84, 92, 76, 81, 56 };
    int maxScore{ 0 };

    // i is the index of the current element.
    for (int i{ 0 }; auto score : scores) {
        if (score > maxScore) {
            std::cout << names[i]
                << " beat the previous best score of "
                << maxScore << " by "
                << (score - maxScore) << " points!\n";
            maxScore = score;
        }

        ++i;
    }

    std::cout << "The best score was "
        << maxScore << ".\n";
}
```

**The `int i{ 0 };` is the init-statement, it only gets executed once when the loop starts.** At the end of each iteration, we increment `i`, similar to a normal for-loop. However, if we were to use `continue` inside the loop, the `++i` would get skipped, leading to unexpected results. *If you use `continue`, you need to make sure that `i` gets incremented before the `continue` is encountered.*

Before C++20, the index variable `i` had to be declared outside of the loop, which could lead to name conflicts when we wanted to define another variable named `i` later in the function.

## Conclusion

`For-each loops` provide a superior syntax for iterating through an array when we need to access all of the array elements in forwards sequential order. It should be preferred over the standard `for loop` in the cases where it can be used. To prevent making copies of each element, the element declaration should ideally be a reference.


## Question


### Question #1

- **Q.** Declare a fixed array with the following names: Alex, Betty, Caroline, Dave, Emily, Fred, Greg, and Holly. Ask the user to enter a name. Use a for each loop to see if the name the user entered is in the array.

    Sample output:  

    ```c++
    Enter a name: Betty
    Betty was found.

    Enter a name: Megatron
    Megatron was not found.
    ```

- **A.** 

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    #include <string_view>

    int main() {
        constexpr std::string_view names[]{
            "Alex", "Betty", "Caroline", "Dave",
            "Emily", "Fred", "Greg", "Holly"
        };

        std::cout << "Enter a name: ";
        std::string username{};
        std::cin >> username;

        bool found{ false };

        for (const auto name : names) {
            if (name == username) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (found)
            std::cout << username << " was found.\n";
        else
            std::cout << username << " was not found.\n";
    }
    ```
