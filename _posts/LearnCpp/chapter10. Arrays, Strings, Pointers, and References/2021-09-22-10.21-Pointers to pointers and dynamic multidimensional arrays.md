This lesson is optional, for advanced readers who want to learn more about C++. No future lessons build on this lesson.

A **pointer to a pointer** is exactly what you’d expect: a pointer that holds the address of another pointer.


## Pointers to pointers

A normal pointer to an `int` is declared using a single asterisk:

```c++
// pointer to an int, one asterisk
int* ptr; 
```

A pointer to a pointer to an `int` is declared using two asterisks

```c++
// pointer to a pointer to an int, two asterisks
int** ptrptr; 
```

A pointer to a pointer works just like a normal pointer — you can perform indirection through it to retrieve the value pointed to. And because that value is itself a pointer, you can perform indirection through it again to get to the underlying value. These indirections can be done consecutively:

```c++
int value{ 5 };

int* ptr{ &value };

// Indirection through pointer to int
// to get int value.
std::cout << *ptr;      // "5"

int** ptrptr{ &ptr };

// first indirection to get pointer to int,
// second indirection to get int value
std::cout << **ptrptr;  // "5"
```

Note that **you cannot set a pointer to a pointer directly to a value**:

```c++
int value{ 5 };

// not valid!
int** ptrptr{ &&value };
```

**This is because the address of operator (`operator&`) requires an lvalue, *but `&value` is an rvalue*.**

**However, a pointer to a pointer *can* be set to null:**

```c++
// Use 0 instead prior to C++11.
int** ptrptr{ nullptr };
```


## Arrays of pointers

Pointers to pointers have a few uses. **The most common use is to dynamically allocate an array of pointers:**

```c++
// Allocate an array of 10 int pointers.
int** array{ new int* [10] };
```

This works just like a standard dynamically allocated array, except the array elements are of type “pointer to integer” instead of integer.


## Two-dimensional dynamically allocated arrays

**Another common use for pointers to pointers is to facilitate dynamically allocated multidimensional arrays** (see [10.5 -- Multidimensional Arrays](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/multidimensional-arrays/) for a review of multidimensional arrays).

Unlike a two dimensional fixed array, which can easily be declared like this:

```c++
int array[10][5];
```

Dynamically allocating a two-dimensional array is a little more challenging. You may be tempted to try something like this:

```c++
int** array { new int[10][5] }; // won’t work!
```

But it won’t work.

There are *two* possible solutions here. **If the rightmost array dimension is a compile-time constant**, you can do this:

```c++
int (*array)[5] { new int[10][5] };
```

**The parenthesis are required here** to ensure proper precedence. In C++11 or newer, this is a good place to use automatic type deduction:

```c++
auto array { new int[10][5] }; // so much simpler!
```

>>>**Example of an dynamically allocated 3-dimensional array**

```c++
// Note : It can be defined when all dimensions
//        except the leftmost are compile-time constants.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int v1{};
    std::cin >> v1;
    std::cout << "--------\n--------\n";

    // type: int(*)[4][5]
    int(*arr3Dim)[4][5]{ new int[v1][4][5] };

    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii)
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < 4; ++jjj)
            for (int kkk{ 0 }; kkk < 5; ++kkk)
                arr3Dim[iii][jjj][kkk] = 5 * 4 * iii + 5 * jjj + kkk;

    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii) {
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < 4; ++jjj) {
            for (int kkk{ 0 }; kkk < 5; ++kkk)
                std::cout << arr3Dim[iii][jjj][kkk] << ' ';
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
        std::cout << "--------\n";
    }

    // Delete only once.    
    delete[] arr3Dim;
}
```

>>>**Example of an dynamically allocated 3-dimensional array**

```c++
// Note : It can be defined when the rightmost array dimension
//        is a compile-time constant.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a{};
    int b{};
    std::cin >> v1 >> b;
    std::cout << "--------\n--------\n";

    // allocate an array of 'v1' pointers of int pointer
    int*** arr3Dim{ new int** [a] };

    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii) {
        arr3Dim[iii] = new int* [v2];

        // allocate an array of 'v2' int pointers
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < v2; ++jjj)
            (arr3Dim[iii])[jjj] = new int[5];
    }

    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii)
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < v2; ++jjj)
            for (int kkk{ 0 }; kkk < 5; ++kkk)
                ((arr3Dim[iii])[jjj])[kkk] = 5 * b * iii + 5 * jjj + kkk;

    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii) {
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < v2; ++jjj) {
            for (int kkk{ 0 }; kkk < 5; ++kkk)
                std::cout << arr3Dim[iii][jjj][kkk] << ' ';
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
        std::cout << "--------\n";
    }

    // Delete Not only once.
    for (int iii{ 0 }; iii < v1; ++iii) {
        for (int jjj{ 0 }; jjj < v2; ++jjj) {
            delete[] arr3Dim[iii][jjj];
        }
        delete[] arr3Dim[iii];
    }
    delete[] arr3Dim;
}
```

**Unfortunately, this relatively simple solution doesn’t work if any non-leftmost array dimension isn’t a compile-time constant.** In that case, we have to get a little more complicated. First, we allocate an array of pointers (as per above). Then we iterate through the array of pointers and allocate a dynamic array for each array element. **Our dynamic two-dimensional array is a dynamic one-dimensional array of dynamic one-dimensional arrays!**

```c++
// allocate an array of 10 int pointers — these are our rows
int** array { new int*[10] }; 
for (int count{ 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    array[count] = new int[5]; // these are our columns
```

We can then access our array like usual:

```c++
array[9][4] = 3; // This is the same as (array[9])[4] = 3;
```

With this method, because each array column is dynamically allocated independently, **it’s possible to make dynamically allocated two dimensional arrays that are not rectangular**. For example, we can make a triangle-shaped array:

```c++
// allocate an array of 10 int pointers — these are our rows
int** array { new int*[10] }; 
for (int count{ 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    array[count] = new int[count+1]; // these are our columns
```

In the above example, note that `array[0]` is an array of length `1`, `array[1]` is an array of length `2`, etc…

Deallocating a dynamically allocated two-dimensional array using this method requires a loop as well:

```c++
for (int count{ 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    delete[] array[count];
delete[] array; // this needs to be done last
```

Note that we delete the array in the *opposite* order that we created it (elements first, then the array itself). If we delete array before the array elements, then we’d have to access deallocated memory to delete the array elements. And that would result in undefined behavior.

Because allocating and deallocating two-dimensional arrays is complex and easy to mess up, it’s often easier to “*flatten*” a two-dimensional array (of size `x` by `y`) into a one-dimensional array of size `x * y`:

```c++
// Instead of this:

int** array { new int*[10] };   // allocate an array of 10 int pointers 
                                // — these are our rows
for (int count{ 0 }; count < 10; ++count)
    array[count] = new int[5];  // these are our columns


// Do this

int *array { new int[50] };     // a (10 * 5) array flattened into a single array
```

Simple math can then be used to convert a row and column index for a rectangular two-dimensional array into a single index for a one-dimensional array:

```c++
int getSingleIndex(int row, int col, int numberOfColumnsInArray) {
     return (row * numberOfColumnsInArray) + col;
}

// set array[9,4] to 3 using our flattened array
array[getSingleIndex(9, 4, 5)] = 3;
```


## Passing a pointer by address

Much like we can use a pointer parameter to change the actual value of the underlying argument passed in, we can pass a pointer to a pointer to a function and use that pointer to change the value of the pointer it points to (confused yet?).

***However, if we want a function to be able to modify what a pointer argument points to, this is generally better done using a reference to a pointer instead.*** So we won’t talk about it further here.

We’ll talk more about pass by address and pass by reference in the next chapter.


## Pointer to a pointer to a pointer to…

It’s also possible to declare a pointer to a pointer to a pointer:

```c++
int*** ptrx3;
```

This can be used to dynamically allocate a three-dimensional array. However, doing so would require a loop inside a loop, and is extremely complicated to get correct.

You can even declare a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer:

```c++
int**** ptrx4;
```

Or higher, if you wish.

However, in reality these don’t see much use because it’s not often you need so much indirection.


## Conclusion

**We recommend avoiding using pointers to pointers unless no other options are available**, because they’re complicated to use and potentially dangerous. It’s easy enough to perform indirection through a null or dangling pointer with normal pointers — it’s doubly easy with a pointer to a pointer since you have to do a double-indirection to get to the underlying value!
