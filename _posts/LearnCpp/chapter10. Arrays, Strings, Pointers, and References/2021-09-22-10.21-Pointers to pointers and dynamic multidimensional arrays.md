A pointer to a pointer is exactly what you’d expect: a pointer that holds the address of another pointer.


## Pointers to pointers


## Arrays of pointers


## Two-dimensional dynamically allocated arrays


## Passing a pointer by address


## Pointer to a pointer to a pointer to…


## Conclusion

We recommend avoiding using pointers to pointers unless no other options are available, because they’re complicated to use and potentially dangerous. It’s easy enough to perform indirection through a null or dangling pointer with normal pointers — it’s doubly easy with a pointer to a pointer since you have to do a double-indirection to get to the underlying value!
