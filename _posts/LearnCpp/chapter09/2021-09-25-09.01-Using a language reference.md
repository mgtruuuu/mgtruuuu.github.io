## Overview

>**A reminder**  
The C++ versions are C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. C++23 is the informal name for the next planned iteration.

>**Warning**  
If you use a search engine and a technical specification has just been accepted into the standard, you might get linked to a technical specification rather than the official reference, which can differ.

>**Tip**  
Cppreference is not only a reference for C++, but also for C. Since C++ shares some functions with C (which can differ), you may find yourself in the C reference after searching for something. The URL and the navigation bar at the top of cppreference always show you if you’re browsing the C or C++ reference.
