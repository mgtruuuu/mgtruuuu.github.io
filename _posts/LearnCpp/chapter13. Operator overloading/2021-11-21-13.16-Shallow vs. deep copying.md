## Shallow copying

Because C++ does not know much about your class, the default copy constructor and default assignment operators it provides use a copying method known as a **memberwise copy** (also known as a **shallow copy**). **This means that C++ copies each member of the class *individually*** (using *the assignment operator for overloaded `operator=`*, and *direct initialization for the copy constructor*). When classes are simple (e.g. do not contain any dynamically allocated memory), this works very well.

For example, let’s take a look at our `Fraction` class:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator{ 0 };
    int m_denominator{ 1 };

public:
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator{ numerator } 
        , m_denominator{ denominator } {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
    out << f1.m_numerator << '/' << f1.m_denominator;

    return out;
}
```

The default copy constructor and default assignment operator provided by the compiler for this class look something like this:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator{ 0 };
    int m_denominator{ 1 };

public:
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator{ numerator }
        , m_denominator{ denominator } {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    // possible implementation of implicit copy constructor
    Fraction(const Fraction& f)
        : m_numerator(f.m_numerator)
        , m_denominator(f.m_denominator) {}

    // possible implementation of implicit assignment operator
    Fraction& operator= (const Fraction& fraction) {

        // self-assignment guard
        if (this == &fraction)
            return *this;

        // Do the copy.
        m_numerator = fraction.m_numerator;
        m_denominator = fraction.m_denominator;

        // Return the existing object 
        // so we can chain this operator.
        return *this;
    }

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
        out << f1.m_numerator << '/' << f1.m_denominator;
        return out;
    }
};
```

Note that because these default versions work just fine for copying this class, there’s really no reason to write our own version of these functions in this case.

However, when designing classes that handle dynamically allocated memory, memberwise (shallow) copying can get us in a lot of trouble! **This is because shallow copies of a pointer just copy the address of the pointer** -- it does not allocate any memory or copy the contents being pointed to!

Let’s take a look at an example of this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>  // for strlen()
#include <cassert>  // for assert()

class MyString {
private:
    char* m_data{};
    size_t m_length{};

public:
    MyString(const char* source = "") {

        // Make sure source isn't a null string.
        assert(source);

        // Find the length of the string.
        // Plus one character for a terminator.
        m_length = std::strlen(source) + 1;

        // Allocate a buffer equal to this length.
        m_data = new char[m_length];

        // Copy the parameter string into our internal buffer.
        for (int i{ 0 }; i < m_length; ++i)
            m_data[i] = source[i];

        // Make sure the string is terminated.
        m_data[m_length - 1] = '\0';
    }

    // Need to deallocate our string.
    ~MyString() { delete[] m_data; }

    char* getString() { return m_data; }
    size_t getLength() { return m_length; }
};
```

The above is a simple string class that allocates memory to hold a string that we pass in. Note that we have not defined a copy constructor or overloaded assignment operator. Consequently, C++ will provide a default copy constructor and default assignment operator that do a shallow copy. The copy constructor will look something like this:

```c++
MyString::MyString(const MyString& source)
    : m_length(source.m_length)
    , m_data(source.m_data) {}
```

Note that `m_data` is just a shallow pointer copy of `source.m_data`, meaning they now both point to the same thing.

Now, consider the following snippet of code:

```c++
int main() {
    MyString hello{ "Hello, world!" };

    {
        // Use default copy constructor.
        MyString copy{ hello };

    }   // copy is a local variable, so it gets destroyed here.
        // The destructor deletes copy's string,
        // which leaves hello with a dangling pointer.

    // This will have undefined behavior.
    std::cout << hello.getString() << '\n';
}
```

While this code looks harmless enough, it contains an insidious problem that will cause the program to crash! Can you spot it? Don’t worry if you can’t, it’s rather subtle.

Let’s break down this example line by line:

```c++
MyString hello{ "Hello, world!" };
```

This line is harmless enough. This calls the `MyString` constructor, which allocates some memory, sets `hello.m_data` to point to it, and then copies the string “Hello, world!” into it.

```c++
// Use default copy constructor.
MyString copy{ hello };
```

This line seems harmless enough as well, but it’s actually the source of our problem! When this line is evaluated, C++ will use the default copy constructor (because we haven’t provided our own). This copy constructor will do a shallow copy, initializing `copy.m_data` to the same address of `hello.m_data`. As a result, `copy.m_data` and `hello.m_data` are now both pointing to the same piece of memory!

```c++
}   // copy is a local variable, so it gets destroyed here.
    // The destructor deletes copy's string,
    // which leaves hello with a dangling pointer.
```

When copy goes out of scope, the `MyString` destructor is called on copy. **The destructor deletes the dynamically allocated memory *that both `copy.m_data` and `hello.m_data` are pointing to*!** Consequently, by deleting copy, we’ve also (inadvertently) affected `hello`. Variable `copy` then gets destroyed, but `hello.m_data` is left pointing to the deleted (invalid) memory!

```c++
// This will have undefined behavior.
std::cout << hello.getString() << '\n';
```

Now you can see why this program has undefined behavior. We deleted the string that `hello` was pointing to, and now we are trying to print the value of memory that is no longer allocated.

The root of this problem is the shallow copy done by the copy constructor -- **doing a shallow copy on pointer values in a copy constructor or overloaded assignment operator is almost always asking for trouble.**


## Deep copying

One answer to this problem is to do a deep copy on any non-null pointers being copied. A **deep copy** allocates memory for the copy and then copies the actual value, so that the copy lives in distinct memory from the source. **This way, the copy and source are distinct and will not affect each other in any way.** *Doing deep copies requires that we write our own copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators.*

Let’s go ahead and show how this is done for our `MyString` class:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>  // for strlen()
#include <cassert>  // for assert()

class MyString {
private:
    char* m_data{};
    size_t m_length{};

public:
    MyString(const char* source = "");
    MyString(const MyString& source);
    ~MyString() { delete[] m_data; }

    void deepCopy(const MyString& source);
    char* getString() { return m_data; }
    size_t getLength() { return m_length; }

    MyString& operator=(const MyString& source);
};

// copy constructor
MyString::MyString(const MyString& source) {
    deepCopy(source);
}

// Assumes m_data is initialized.
void MyString::deepCopy(const MyString& source) {

    // First we need to deallocate any value 
    // that this string is holding!
    delete[] m_data;

    // Because m_length is not a pointer, 
    // we can shallow copy it.
    m_length = source.m_length;

    // m_data is a pointer, 
    // so we need to deep copy it if it is non-null.
    if (source.m_data) {

        // Allocate memory for our copy.
        m_data = new char[m_length];

        // Do the copy.
        for (int i{ 0 }; i < m_length; ++i)
            m_data[i] = source.m_data[i];
    }
    else
        m_data = nullptr;
}

// assignment operator
MyString& MyString::operator=(const MyString& source) {

    // Check for self-assignment.
    if (this != &source)    deepCopy(source);

    return *this;
}

MyString::MyString(const char* source) {
    assert(source);

    m_length = std::strlen(source) + 1;

    m_data = new char[m_length];

    for (int i{ 0 }; i < m_length; ++i)
        m_data[i] = source[i];

    m_data[m_length - 1] = '\0';
}
```

As you can see, this is quite a bit more involved than a simple shallow copy! First, we have to check to make sure `source` even has a string (line 40). If it does, then we allocate enough memory to hold a copy of that string (line 43). Finally, we have to manually copy the string (lines 46 and 47).

Now let’s do the overloaded assignment operator. Note that our assignment operator is very similar to our copy constructor, but there are three major differences:

- We added a self-assignment check.
- We return `*this` so we can chain the assignment operator.
- We need to explicitly deallocate any value that the string is already holding (so we don’t have a memory leak when `m_data` is reallocated later).

When the overloaded assignment operator is called, the item being assigned to may already contain a previous value, which we need to make sure we clean up before we assign memory for new values. For non-dynamically allocated variables (which are a fixed size), we don’t have to bother because the new value just overwrite the old one. However, for dynamically allocated variables, we need to explicitly deallocate any old memory before we allocate any new memory. If we don’t, the code will not crash, but we will have a memory leak that will eat away our free memory every time we do an assignment!


### A better solution

Classes in the standard library that deal with dynamic memory, such as `std::string` and `std::vector`, handle all of their memory management, and have overloaded copy constructors and assignment operators that do proper deep copying. So instead of doing your own memory management, you can just initialize or assign them like normal fundamental variables! That makes these classes simpler to use, less error-prone, and you don’t have to spend time writing your own overloaded functions!


## Summary

- The default copy constructor and default assignment operators do **shallow copies**, which is fine for classes that contain no dynamically allocated variables.
- Classes with dynamically allocated variables need to have a copy constructor and assignment operator that do a **deep copy**.
- Favor using classes in the standard library over doing your own memory management.
