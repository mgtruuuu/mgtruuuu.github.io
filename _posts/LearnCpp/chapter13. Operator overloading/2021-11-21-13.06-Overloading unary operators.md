## Overloading unary operators

Unlike the operators you’ve seen so far, the positive (`+`), negative (`-`) and logical not (`!`) operators all are unary operators, which means they only operate on *one* operand. **Because they *only* operate on the object they are applied to**, typically unary operator overloads are implemented as member functions. All three operands are implemented in an identical manner.

Let’s take a look at how we’d implement operator- on the Cents class we used in a previous example:

```c++
#include <iostream>

class Cents {
private:
    int m_cents{};

public:
    Cents(int cents) : m_cents(cents) {}

    // Overload -Cents as a member function
    Cents operator-() const;

    int getCents() const { return m_cents; }
};

// note: This function is a member function!
Cents Cents::operator-() const {
    // Since return type is a Cents,
    // this does an implicit conversion from int to Cents
    // using the Cents(int) constructor.
    return -m_cents;
}

int main() {
    const Cents nickle{ 5 };
    std::cout << "A nickle of debt is worth "
        << (-nickle).getCents() << " cents\n";
}
```

This should be straightforward. Our overloaded negative operator (`-`) is a unary operator implemented as a member function, so it takes no parameters (it operates on the `*this` object). It returns a `Cents` object that is the negation of the original `Cents` value. Because `operator-` does not modify the `Cents` object, we can (and should) make it a const function (so it can be called on `const Cents` objects).

Note that there’s no confusion between the negative `operator-` and the minus `operator-` since they have a different number of parameters.

Here’s another example. The `!` operator is the logical negation operator -- if an expression evaluates to “`true`”, `operator!` will return `false`, and vice-versa. We commonly see this applied to boolean variables to test whether they are `true` or not:

```c++
if (!isHappy)
    std::cout << "I am not happy!\n";
else
    std::cout << "I am so happy!\n";
```

For integers, 0 evaluates to `false`, and anything else to `true`, so `operator!` as applied to integers will return `true` for an integer value of `0` and `false` otherwise.

Extending the concept, we can say that `operator!` should evaluate to `true` if the state of the object is “`false`”, “zero”, or whatever the default initialization state is.

The following example shows an overload of both `operator-` and `operator!` for a user-defined `Point` class:

```c++
#include <iostream>

class Point {
private:
    double m_x{};
    double m_y{};
    double m_z{};

public:
    Point(double x = 0.0, double y = 0.0, double z = 0.0)
        : m_x{ x }, m_y{ y }, m_z{ z } {}

    // Convert a Point into its negative equivalent.
    Point operator- () const;

    // Return true if the point is set at the origin.
    bool operator! () const;

    double getX() const { return m_x; }
    double getY() const { return m_y; }
    double getZ() const { return m_z; }
};

// Convert a Point into its negative equivalent.
Point Point::operator- () const {
    return Point(-m_x, -m_y, -m_z);
}

// Return true if the point is set at the origin, false otherwise.
bool Point::operator! () const {
    return (m_x == 0.0 && m_y == 0.0 && m_z == 0.0);
}

int main() {
    // Use default constructor to set to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
    Point point{}; 

    if (!point)
        std::cout << "point is set at the origin.\n";
    else
        std::cout << "point is not set at the origin.\n";
    // "point is set at the origin."
}
```

The overloaded `operator!` for this class returns the Boolean value “`true`” if the `Point` is set to the default value at coordinate `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Thus, the above code produces the result:
