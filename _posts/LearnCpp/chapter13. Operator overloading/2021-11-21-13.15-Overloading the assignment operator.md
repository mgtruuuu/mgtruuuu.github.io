**The assignment operator** (`operator=`) is used to copy values from one object to another *already existing object*.


## Assignment vs Copy constructor

The purpose of the copy constructor and the assignment operator are almost equivalent -- **both copy one object to another**. **However, the *copy constructor* initializes new objects, whereas the *assignment operator* replaces the contents of existing objects.**

The difference between the copy constructor and the assignment operator causes a lot of confusion for new programmers, but it’s really not all that difficult. Summarizing:

- If a new object *has to* be created before the copying can occur, the copy constructor is used (note: this includes *passing or returning objects by value*).
- If a new object *does not have to* be created before the copying can occur, the assignment operator is used.


## Overloading the assignment operator

Overloading the assignment operator (`operator=`) is fairly straightforward, with one specific caveat that we’ll get to. **The assignment operator must be overloaded as a member function.**

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator{ 0 };
    int m_denominator{ 1 };

public:
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator(numerator), m_denominator(denominator) {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    Fraction(const Fraction& copy)
        : m_numerator{ copy.m_numerator }
        , m_denominator{ copy.m_denominator } {
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    }

    // overloaded assignment
    Fraction& operator= (const Fraction& fraction);

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
    out << f1.m_numerator << "/" << f1.m_denominator;
    return out;
}

// A simplistic implementation of operator= 
// (see better implementation below).
Fraction& Fraction::operator= (const Fraction& fraction) {

    // Do the copy.
    m_numerator = fraction.m_numerator;
    m_denominator = fraction.m_denominator;

    // Return the existing object 
    // so we can chain this operator.
    return *this;
}

int main() {
    Fraction fiveThirds{ 5, 3 };
    Fraction f;

    // Calls overloaded assignment.
    f = fiveThirds;
    std::cout << f;     // "5/3"
}
```

This should all be pretty straightforward by now. Our overloaded `operator=` returns `*this`, so that we can chain multiple assignments together:

```c++
int main() {
    Fraction f1{ 5, 3 };
    Fraction f2{ 7, 2 };
    Fraction f3{ 9, 5 };

    // chained assignment
    f1 = f2 = f3;
}
```


## Issues due to self-assignment

Here’s where things start to get a little more interesting. **C++ allows self-assignment:**

```c++
int main() {
    Fraction f1{ 5, 3 };

    // self assignment
    f1 = f1;
}
```

This will call `f1.operator=(f1)`, and under the simplistic implementation above, all of the members will be assigned to themselves. *In this particular example, the self-assignment causes each member to be assigned to itself, which has no overall impact, other than wasting time.* **In most cases, a self-assignment doesn’t need to do anything at all!**

**However, in cases where an assignment operator needs to dynamically assign memory, self-assignment can actually be dangerous:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

class MyString {
private:
    char* m_data{};
    int m_length{};

public:
    MyString(const char* data = nullptr, int length = 0)
        : m_length{ length } {
        if (length) {
            m_data = new char[length];

            for (int i{ 0 }; i < length; ++i)
                m_data[i] = data[i];
        }
    }

    ~MyString() { delete[] m_data; }

    // overloaded assignment
    MyString& operator= (const MyString& str);

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const MyString& s);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const MyString& s) {
    out << s.m_data;

    return out;
}

// a simplistic implementation of operator= (do not use.)
MyString& MyString::operator= (const MyString& str) {

    // If data exists in the current string, delete it.
    if (m_data)     delete[] m_data;

    m_length = str.m_length;

    // Copy the data from str to the implicit object.
    m_data = new char[str.m_length];

    for (int i{ 0 }; i < str.m_length; ++i)
        m_data[i] = str.m_data[i];

    // Return the existing object so we can chain this operator.
    return *this;
}

int main() {
    MyString alex("Alex", 5);   // Meet Alex.

    MyString employee;
    employee = alex;            // Alex is our newest employee

    std::cout << employee;      // Say your name, employee
    // "Alex"
}
```

First, run the program as it is. You’ll see that the program prints “Alex” as it should.

Now run the following program:

```c++
int main() {
    MyString alex{ "Alex", 5 };     // Meet Alex.

    alex = alex;                    // Alex is himself.

    std::cout << alex;              // Say your name, Alex.
}
```

You’ll probably get garbage output. What happened?

Consider what happens in the overloaded `operator=` when the implicit object AND the passed in parameter (`str`) are both variable `alex`. In this case, `m_data` is the same as `str.m_data`. The first thing that happens is that the function checks to see if the implicit object already has a string. If so, it needs to delete it, so we don’t end up with a memory leak. In this case, `m_data` is allocated, so the function deletes `m_data`. **But because `str` is the same as `*this`, the string that we wanted to copy has been deleted and `m_data` (and `str.m_data`) are dangling.**

Later on, we allocate new memory to `m_data` (and `str.m_data`). So when we subsequently copy the data from `str.m_data` into `m_data`, we’re copying garbage, because `str.m_data` was never initialized.


## Detecting and handling self-assignment

Fortunately, we can detect when self-assignment occurs. Here’s an updated implementation of our overloaded `operator=` for the `MyString` class:

```c++
MyString& MyString::operator= (const MyString& str) {

    // self-assignment check
    if (this == &str)   return *this;

    if (m_data)         delete[] m_data;

    m_length = str.m_length;

    m_data = new char[str.m_length];

    for (int i{ 0 }; i < str.m_length; ++i)
        m_data[i] = str.m_data[i];

    return *this;
}
```

*By checking if the address of our implicit object is the same as the address of the object being passed in as a parameter, we can have our assignment operator just return immediately without doing any other work.*

Because this is just a pointer comparison, **it should be fast, and does not require `operator==` to be overloaded**.


## When not to handle self-assignment

**Typically the self-assignment check is skipped for *copy constructors*.** Because the object being copy constructed is newly created, the only case where the newly created object can be equal to the object being copied is when you try to initialize a newly defined object with itself:

```c++
someClass c{ c };
```

In such cases, your compiler should warn you that `c` is an uninitialized variable.

Second, **the self-assignment check may be omitted in *classes that can naturally handle self-assignment***. Consider this `Fraction` class assignment operator that has a self-assignment guard:

```c++
// a better implementation of operator=
Fraction& Fraction::operator= (const Fraction& fraction) {

    // self-assignment guard
    if (this == &fraction)      return *this;

    // Can handle self-assignment.
    m_numerator = fraction.m_numerator;
    // Can handle self-assignment.
    m_denominator = fraction.m_denominator;

    return *this;
}
```

If the self-assignment guard did not exist, this function would still operate correctly during a self-assignment (because all of the operations done by the function can handle self-assignment properly).

Because self-assignment is a rare event, some prominent C++ gurus recommend omitting the self-assignment guard even in classes that would benefit from it. We do not recommend this, as we believe it’s a better practice to code defensively and then selectively optimize later.


## The copy and swap idiom

A better way to handle self-assignment issues is via what’s called **the copy and swap idiom**. There’s a great writeup of how this idiom works on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom).

>>>

```c++
#include <algorithm>    // std::copy
#include <cstddef>      // std::size_t

class dumb_array {
private:
    std::size_t mSize;
    int* mArray;

public:
    dumb_array(std::size_t size = 0)
        : mSize(size)
        , mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize]() : nullptr) {}

    dumb_array(const dumb_array& other)
        : mSize(other.mSize)
        , mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize] : nullptr) {

        // Note that this is non-throwing, 
        // because of the data types being used; 
        // More attention to detail with regards to exceptions 
        // must be given in a more general case, however.
        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + mSize, mArray);
    }

    // destructor
    ~dumb_array() { delete[] mArray; }

    // nothrow
    friend void swap(dumb_array& first, dumb_array& second) {

        // enable ADL (not necessary in our case, but good practice)
        // (ADL stands for Algorithm Description Language)
        using std::swap;

        // by swapping the members of two objects,
        // the two objects are effectively swapped
        swap(first.mSize, second.mSize);
        swap(first.mArray, second.mArray);
    }

    dumb_array& operator=(dumb_array other) {
        swap(*this, other);

        return *this;
    }
};
```


## Default assignment operator

Unlike other operators, **the compiler will provide a default public assignment operator for your class if you do not provide one**. *This assignment operator does memberwise assignment (which is essentially the same as the memberwise initialization that default copy constructors do).*

Just like other constructors and operators, **you can prevent assignments from being made by making your assignment operator private or using the `delete` keyword**:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

class Fraction {
private:
    int m_numerator{ 0 };
    int m_denominator{ 1 };

public:
    Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1)
        : m_numerator{ numerator }, m_denominator{ denominator } {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }

    Fraction(const Fraction& copy) = delete;

    // overloaded assignment
    // No copies through assignment!
    Fraction& operator= (const Fraction& fraction) = delete;

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction& f1) {
    out << f1.m_numerator << "/" << f1.m_denominator;
    return out;
}

int main() {
    Fraction fiveThirds{ 5, 3 };
    Fraction f;

    // compile error! operator= has been deleted.
    f = fiveThirds;
    std::cout << f;
}
```
