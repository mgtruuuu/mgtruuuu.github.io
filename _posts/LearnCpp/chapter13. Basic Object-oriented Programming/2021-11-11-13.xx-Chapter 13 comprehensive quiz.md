In this chapter, we explored the meat of C++ -- object-oriented programming! This is the most important chapter in the tutorial series.


## Quick Summary

Classes allow you to create your own data types that bundle both data and functions that work on that data. Data and functions inside the class are called members. Members of the class are selected by using the . operator (or -> if you’re accessing the member through a pointer).

Access specifiers allow you to specify who can access the members of a class. Public members can be accessed directly by anybody. Private members can only be accessed by other members of the class. We’ll cover protected members later, when we get to inheritance. By default, all members of a class are private and all members of a struct are public.

Encapsulation is the process of making all of your member data private, so it can not be accessed directly. This helps protect your class from misuse.

Constructors are a special type of member function that allow you to initialize objects of your class. A constructor that takes no parameters (or has all default parameters) is called a default constructor. The default constructor is used if no initialization values are provided by the user. You should always provide at least one constructor for your classes.

Member initializer lists allows you to initialize your member variables from within a constructor (rather than assigning the member variables values).

Non-static member initialization allows you to directly specify default values for member variables when they are declared.

Constructors are allowed to call other constructors (called delegating constructors, or constructor chaining).

Destructors are another type of special member function that allow your class to clean up after itself. Any kind of deallocation or shutdown routines should be executed from here.

All member functions have a hidden *this pointer that points at the class object being modified. Most of the time you will not need to access this pointer directly. But you can if you need to.

It is good programming style to put your class definitions in a header file of the same name as the class, and define your class functions in a .cpp file of the same name as the class. This also helps avoid circular dependencies.

Member functions can (and should) be made const if they do not modify the state of the class. Const class objects can only call const member functions.

Static member variables are shared among all objects of the class. Although they can be accessed from a class object, they can also be accessed directly via the scope resolution operator.

Similarly, static member functions are member functions that have no *this pointer. They can only access static member variables.

Friend functions are functions that are treated like member functions of the class (and thus can access a class’s private data directly). Friend classes are classes where all members of the class are considered friend functions.

It’s possible to create anonymous class objects for the purpose of evaluation in an expression, or passing or returning a value.

You can also nest types within a class. This is often used with enums related to the class, but can be done with other types (including other classes) if desired.

### Question #3

```c++
#include <array>
#include <ctime> // for time()
#include <cstdlib> // for rand() and srand()
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>

class Monster {
public:
	enum Type {
		dragon,
		goblin,
		ogre,
		orc,
		skeleton,
		troll,
		vampire,
		zombie,

		max_monster_types
	};

private:

	Type m_type{};
	std::string m_name{};
	std::string m_roar{};
	int m_hitPoints{};

public:
	Monster(Type type, const std::string& name, const std::string& roar, int hitPoints)
		: m_type{ type }, m_name{ name }, m_roar{ roar }, m_hitPoints{ hitPoints } {}

	std::string_view getTypeString() const {
		switch (m_type) {
		case dragon:		return "dragon";
		case goblin:		return "goblin";
		case ogre:			return "ogre";
		case orc:			return "orc";
		case skeleton:		return "skeleton";
		case troll:			return "troll";
		case vampire:		return "vampire";
		case zombie:		return "zombie";
		default: return "???";
		}
	}

	void print() const {
		std::cout << m_name << " the " << getTypeString() 
			<< " has " << m_hitPoints << " hit points and says " << m_roar << '\n';
	}
};

class MonsterGenerator {
public:
	// Generate a random number between min and max (inclusive).
	// Assumes std::srand() has already been called.
	// Assumes max - min <= RAND_MAX.
	static int getRandomNumber(int min, int max) {

		// static used for efficiency, so we only calculate this value once.
		static constexpr double fraction{ 1.0 / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) };  
		// evenly distribute the random number across our range

		return min + static_cast<int>((max - min + 1) * (std::rand() * fraction));
	}

	static Monster generateMonster() {
		auto type{ static_cast<Monster::Type>(getRandomNumber(0, static_cast<int>(Monster::Type::max_monster_types) - 1)) };
		int hitPoints{ getRandomNumber(1, 100) };

		// If your compiler is not C++17 capable, use std::array<const char*, 6> instead.
		static constexpr std::array s_names{ "Blarg", "Moog", "Pksh", "Tyrn", "Mort", "Hans" };
		static constexpr std::array s_roars{ "*ROAR*", "*peep*", "*squeal*", "*whine*", "*hum*", "*burp*" };

		// Without the cast, compilers with a high warning level complain about
		// an implicit cast from a signed to an unsigned integer.
		auto name{ s_names[getRandomNumber(0, static_cast<int>(s_names.size() - 1))] };
		auto roar{ s_roars[getRandomNumber(0, static_cast<int>(s_roars.size() - 1))] };

		return { type, name, roar, hitPoints };
	}
};

int main() {

	// Set initial seed value to system clock.
	std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(nullptr))); 

	// If using Visual Studio, discard first random value.
	std::rand();					

	Monster m{ MonsterGenerator::generateMonster() };
	m.print();
}
```

- **Q.** Why did we declare variables `s_names` and `s_roars` as static?

- **A.** Making `s_names` and `s_roars` static causes them to be initialized only once. Otherwise, they would get reinitialized every time `generateMonster()` was called.

>**A reminder**  
When using a `std::array` (or `std::vector`) where the elements are a class type, your element’s class must have a default constructor so the elements can be initialized to a reasonable default state. If you do not provide one, you’ll get a cryptic error about attempting to reference a deleted function.


- **Q.** Why did we write the following statement like this:  
    ```c++
    int playerCard{ player.drawCard(deck) };
    std::cout << "The player drew a card with value " << playerCard 
        << " and now has score " << player.score() << '\n';
    ```
    Instead of like this?  
    ```c++
    std::cout << "The player drew a card with value " << player.drawCard(deck) 
        << " and now has score " << player.score() << '\n';
    ```

- **A.** C++ does not have many guarantees on the order in which expressions evaluate. In the latter snippet, either `player.drawCard()` or `player.score()` could evaluate first. Normally this wouldn’t matter, but `player.drawCard()` has the side effect of modifying the score that `player.score()` returns. If `player.score()` evaluates first, it will return the player’s score before the card is drawn, which isn’t what we want. In the former snippet, we put the card draw as a separate statement in order to guarantee it executes first, so that `player.score()` will return the score after the card draw.
